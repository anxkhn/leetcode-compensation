You are also given an array of indices, fountains, which are source points for water. Water flows from these fountains to the left and right, filling any areas lower than the fountain's height until it hits a \"wall\" (a point higher than or equal to the fountain) or the edge of the array. The goal is to determine the final water level across the surface.\nExample\nsurface = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nfountains = [1, 3] (Fountains at index 1 (height 2) and index 3 (height 4))\nMy Approach & Performance\nHere is a breakdown of my performance during the interview, including timing and thought process.\nApproach 1: Brute Force\nExplanation (10 mins): I first described the brute-force solution. For each fountain, simulate the water flow outwards (one pointer to the left, one to the right). Keep track of the maximum water level at each position.\nComplexity:\nTime: O(N * K) where N is the number of points and K is the number of fountains.\nSpace: O(N) to store the water levels.\nCoding (5 mins): I successfully coded this solution quickly.\nApproach 2: Optimal (Monotonic Stack)\nExplanation (10 mins for initial dry run): I identified that the problem could be optimized by pre-calculating the \"next greater element\" to the left and right for each point. This is a classic use case for a monotonic stack. My initial attempt to dry-run this approach was shaky and took a significant amount of time.\nReset & Re-explanation (2-3 mins): I took a moment to reset, then successfully explained the logic more clearly.\nCoding (5 mins): I started coding the optimal logic but ran out of time. I was only able to get about halfway through the implementation.\nLike, I coded the logic but did not return the array.\nComplexity:\nTime: O(N) because the monotonic stack approach processes each element a constant number of times.\nSpace: O(N) for the stack.\nTakeaways & Advice for Round 2\nSo, do any of you have feedback for me for Round 2?\nAnd what are key things I should improve?\nIs it hire/lean hire/strong hire?", "vote_count": 2, "comment_count": 3, "view_count": 696, "creation_date": "2025-09-02 05:45:29"}

Discussed TC.\nQ2: https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/description/\nDiscussed lexicographical approach then interviewer asked to think of several testcases and dry run them. Figured out the problem with my initial approach and discussed optimal approach with merge sort and heap sort. Wrote the recursive call tree for a sample case. Discussed TC and recursive call SC. Coding was not asked for this question.\nQ3: Explain BFS and DFS and discuss when to use.\nDiscussed the traversal algorithms and data structures for implementation. Discussed about infinite branch problem of DFS. Discussed custom traversal approach based on some heuristic combining BFS and DFS for faster convergence like IDDFS.

Wrote structured classes, functions and data structures for players, position, board, and gameplay. Discussed some optimizations of time and space and implemented them. Interviewer pointed out some edge cases and made required edits.\nHad some time leftover and interviewer was in Copilot team so got a chance to discuss the latest developments of AI and LLM happening inside Microsoft and what might be coming next.\n[Self Verdict: Strong Hire]\nFinal Verdict \ud83c\udf89\nGot verbal offer and document submission mail within 3 working days.

Find the minimum total time in which all persons can cross the bridge.\nCorrect Code is written But im confused with option2\nInput: times[] = [10, 20, 30]\nOutput: 60\nExplanation: Total time incurred in whole journey will be 20 + 10 + 30 = 60\nFirstly person '1' and '2' cross the bridge with total time about 20 min(maximum of 10, 20)\nNow the person '1' will come back with total time of '10' minutes.\nLastly the person '1' and '3' cross the bridge with total time about 30 minutes\nInput: times = [1, 2, 5, 8}\nOutput: 15\nCase 1: The two fastest people cross first, then the fastest one returns with the torch, allowing the two slowest to cross.

The very next day, recuriter reached out to me and told me that I had cleared the OA.\nShe asked me if I am interested in SysDev role instead of the role which I have applied for. I politely said no, to which she said that she would reach back to me. I waited for 2 days and I did not get any response from her. When I pinged her, she said that we cannot move forward with your profile for SDE - II role, if you are interested in SysDev role, I will schedule the rounds. I again politely said no and moved one.\nNow, Fast forward to 5 months, i.e last month, another recruiter reached out to me if I am available for interview next friday. I was confused, and I asked her if I am eligible for this role as the other recruiter said no.\nBut, she was like, you are eligible, just let me know your availability.\nI said, I am available and she scheduled 2 rounds - DSA and LLD.\nRound 1(DSA): Started with Leadership principles, which went on for 40 minutes. Then he asked me if we can extend the interview by 10 to 15 mins, to which I said yes. Then he asked me a DSA Question. The question was to find the shortest path between two pieces in a chess board with obstacles. A classic BFS problem!!!\nI gave the BFS approach and he asked me why cant we use DFS. For which, we had a solid discussion around.\nThe interviewer had a specific implementation in mind. For example, using a set for visited elements instead of using a boolean array.\nI quickly understood what he wanted and adapted to that.\nRound 2(LLD): Again, started with Leadership principles, which went on for 20 minutes. Then came the LLD question - Design a parking lot.\nI gathered the requirements and listed the classes with their behaviour and attributes. I also listed the design patterns to be used.\nThen he asked me to implement couple of methods in the design, which I did.\nOverall, this went well as well.\nRound 3(HLD): And again, started with Leadership principles, which went on for half an hour. The HLD question was to Design Leetcode(any online judge). I did not practice HLD a lot. I fumbled in this round, but somehow I managed to complete the design.\nOverall, this was an ok round.\nRound 4(Bar raiser): Yet again, started with Leadership principles for 20 minutes. Then asked a DSA question - Something like task scheduler where each task has dependencies. He asked me to implement a solution which ensures there is not task starvation - this means I shouldn't be using a queue for visiting the tasks while doing the topological sorting.\nHe gave me a few clues and I was able to quickly grab those.\nThe solution was to implement topological sorting using DFS.\nAfter a week or so, I got the hire call.\nFinally after being rejected by google and Microsoft, it was nice to get an offer.\nMicrosoft Interview experience: https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/7015857/microsoft-swe-iii-hyderabad-by-anonymous-nt9n/\nGoogle Interview experience: https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6705226/google-swe-iii-interview-experience-hyde-e8d9/\nAmazon comp breakup:\nCurrent comp: 22LPA(20 fixed and 2 variable)\nFixed(base): 45LPA\nFirst year joining bonus: 19L\nSecond year joining bonus: 14.5L\nRelocation: 1.5L\nStocks: 50K$ - vested over four years - 5%, 15%, 40%, 40%\nRole: SDE - II\nFirst year total comp: 66LPA Approx.", "vote_count": 25, "comment_count": 16, "view_count": 2994, "creation_date": "2025-07-28 13:23:56"}

At Atlassian \u2013 there are multiple groups, and each can have one or more groups. Every employee is part of a group. You are tasked with designing a system that could find the closest common parent group giv a target set of employees in the organization.\nb) The Atlassian hierarchy sometimes can have shared group across an org or employees shared across different groups \u2013 How will the code evolve n this case if the requirement is to provide ONE closest common group\nc) The system now introduced 4 methods to update the structure of the hierarchy in the org. Supose these dynamic updates are done in separate threads while getCommonGroupForEmployees is being called, How ill your system handled reads and writes into the system efficiently such that at any given time getCommonGroupForEmployees always reflects the latest updated state of the hierarchy?\nd) The company consists of a single level of groups with no subgroups. Each group has a set of employees.\nExpanding Tennis Club\na) Implement a function that given a list of tennis court cookings with start and finish times, returns a plan assigning each booking to a specific court, ensuring each court is used by only one booking at a time and using the minimum amount of courts with unlimites number of courts available.\nAn example of the booking record might look like\nClass BookingRecord:\nId: int//ID of the booking\nStart_time: int\nFinish_time: int\nAnd our function is going to look like:\nList assignCourts(List bookingRecords)\nb) After each booking, a fixed amount of time, X, is needed to maintain the court before it can be rented again\nc) Court only need maintainenece after X amount of usage\nHow would you modify the code if each court also had a Y maintainence time that occurred after X bookings?\nThe function should now become something like\nDef assign_court_with_maintainence(booking_records: list{BookingRecord],\nMaintainence_time: int,\nDurability: int) -> list[Court]:\nd) The original problem can be made simpler by removing the \u201cassigning each booking to a specific court\u201d part. The candidate needs to find the minimum number of courts needed to accommodate all the bookings\ne) Check if booking conflict - Write a function that if given two bookings to check if they conflict with each other\nCommodity Prices\nImagine you are given a stream of data points consisting of <timestamp, commodityPrice> you are supposed to return the maxCommodityPrice at any point in time.\nThe timestamps in the stream can be out of order, or there can be duplicate timestamps, we need to update the commodityPrice at that particular timestamp if an entry for the timestamp already exists\nCreate an in-memory solution tailored to prioritize frequent reads and writes for the given problem statement\nCan we reduce the time complexity of the getMaxCommodityPrice to O(1) if the language does not support it? This can be done using a variable to keep the maxPrice value, but we need to update it when performing the upsert operations.\nPopular content\nImagine you are given a stream of content ids along with an associated action to be performed on them\nExample of contents are video, pages, posts etc. There cam be two actions associated with a content id:\n\u2022 increasePopularity -> increases the popularity of the content by 1. The popularity increases when someone comments on the content or likes the comtent\n\u2022 decreasePopularity-> decreases the popularity of the content by 1. The popularity decreases when a spam bot\u2019s/users comments are deleted from the content or its likes are removed from the content\n\u2022 content ids are positive integers\nImplement a class that can return the mostPopular content id at any time while consuming the stream of content ids and its associated action. If there are no contentIds with popularity greater than 0, return -1\nCode Design Question Bank\nCustomer Satisfaction\na) Imagine we have a customer support ticketing system. The system allows customers to rate the support agent out of 5. To start with, write a function which accepts a rating, and another which will show me all of the agents and the average ratingeach one has received, ordered highest to lowest.\nb) Currently your solution does not account for what happens if two agents have the same average rating. What options are there for handling ties and how can we implement that in code?\nc) Now I want to be able to see who the best agents are each month. Change the implementation so I can get that information.\nd) Write a new function that will allow me to export of each agent\u2019s average ratings per month. You can export in any format you like- for example csv,json or xml.\ne) Make it return the average ratings unsorted./ Make it return the total rating for each agent without the average\nMiddleware Router\na) We want to implement a middleware router for our web service, which based on the path returns different strings\nOur interface for the router looks something like:\nInterface Router {\nFun addRoute(path: String, result: String) : Unit;\nFun callRoute(path:String) :String;\n}\nUsage:\nRouter.addRoute(\u201c/bar\u201d , \u201cresult)\nRouter.callRoute(\u201c/bar\u201d) -> \u201cresult\u201d\nScale Up 1 \u2013 Wildcards using ordered checking\nScale Up 2 \u2013 PathParams\nGame of Snakes\nRemember the old phone game of snake? The snake can move up, down, left or right in a 2Dimensional board of arbitrary size.\nLets try to pmplement the bae logic of this game\nRules:\n\u2022 Every time moveSnake() is called, the snake moves up, down, left or right\n\u2022 The snake\u2019s initial size is 3 and grows by 1 every 5 moves\n\u2022 The game ends when the snake hits itself\nWe can use the following as a starting point (pseudo-code):\nInterface SnakeGame {\nmoveSnake(snakeDirection);\nisGameOver();\n}\nProposed Changes\nChange#1\nMake scale-up 2 optional\nRemove scale-up 2 completely\nChange#2\nAdd new optional scale up: snake grows when it eats food rather than every 5moves. Food is dropped at a random position on the board.\nCost Explorer\nImagine you are working on payments team at Atlassian. A customer subscribes to Jira and is interested in exploring how much it \u2018ill cost them to keep using the product for the rest of the year\nYour task is to develop a COstExplorer that calculates the total cost a customer has to pay in a unit year .

As an example, let\u2019s look at three of our products:\nJira \u2013 Issues\nConfluence \u2013 Pages\nBitbucket \u2013 Pull requests\nWe want to build a system that allows users to tag content from different products, and then to view content by tags. A goal of this system is that it should be built on a product-agnostic way, so that we could add new products in the future without a large amount of work.\nThere are three key experiences that we want to build here:\nAs a user, I can add, remove and update tags on content\nAs a user, I can click on a tag and see all content that has been associated with that tag\nAs a user, I can see a dashboard of popular tags\nImagine that you are on a team that needs to design and build the system to power this experience.\nSteps\nPart 1: API Design\nPart 2: Data modeling\nPart 3: Scaling up the popular tags API\nPart 4: Scaling up remaining API\u2019s\nPart 5: Introducing Permissions\nQuestion 2 \u2013 Scrapper\nDesign a service which receives as input a list of URLs ,scrapes those URLs for links to other pages and references to images(i.e., the src component of img tags), then returns a mapping of page URLs to a list of image URLs.\nYour service does not need to download and store the images\nYour service should follow links to other pages from the original submitted pages, and return the images on those 2/3/nth level pages as if they were on the first level page.\nThe API contract is defined as :\nPOST ing to /jobs with a body of a JSON array of URLs to start scraping from(e.g [\u201chttps:/google.com\u201d ,https://www.statuspage.io]) should return a job identifier of some kind\nGET ing/jobs/:job_id/status with the returned job identifier should return a JSON object of the format of {\u201ccompleted\u201d:x, \u201cin_progress\u201d: y} where x is the number of original URLs which have been completely crawled and y is the number of original URLs which are still being crawled.\nGET ing /jobs/:job_id/results with the returned job identifier should return a JSON object returning a mapping of original URL to all reachable images from that original URL, in the format of\n{\n\u201chttps:/google/com\u201d:{\nhttps://google.com/images/logo_sm_2.gif,\nhttps://google.com/images/warning.gif\n],\nhttps://www/statuspage.io: [\nhttps://statuspage.io/logo.png,\nhttps://statuspage.io/other-logo.png\n]\n}\nSteps\nPart 1: Introduction\nPart 2: Requirement Gathering\nPart 3: Architecture Diagram\nPart 4: Data Model\nPart 5: Scaling Up\nQuestion 3 \u2013 Hierarchical Data Storage System\nDesign a system to store and retrieve a hierarchica odel which can be store any data with the following characteristics\nAll nodes are under a root node, the root node doesn\u2019t have any parent\nThere can be multiple root nodes\nEach node can have multiple child nodes\nWe need to design the following functionality into the system\nAdd child node to any node\nGet all the children of a node, along with an indicator to show if each child node have further children or not, lets call this the TERMINAL node indicator\nYou do NOT have to worry about what is exactly stored in the nodes, they can represent any data like confluence pages hierarchy or file system in operating systems or employee storage systems in organizations with manager-employee relationships or a heterogeneous systems that can store multiple types of nodes.\nPart 1: API Design\nPart 2: Data Modelling\nPart 3 : Box Diagram\nScale Up 1 : View ancestors\nScale Up 2: Scale APIs\nScale Up 3: Reorder Nodes\nScaleUp 4: Permission Handling\nQuestion 4 \u2013 Design the confluence Popular Feed\nDesign the popular feed on a content authoring platform such as Confluence\nSteps\nPart 1 \u2013 Systems API\nPart 2 \u2013 Data Modelling\nPart 3 \u2013 High level architecture Design\nPart 4 \u2013 Level ups\nQuestion 5 \u2013 Color Picker\nDesign a web application that allows me to pick my favourite color and save it.

{"id": "6942560", "title": "Past the Hashtag: Building a Certified People Group on Instagram for Your Innovative Business", "content": "Presentation:\nInstagram. It's a visual blowout, a center point for motivation, and a strong showcasing device. However, for innovative organizations, essentially posting pretty pictures and slapping on a couple of hashtags isn't sufficient to slice through the commotion. To flourish, you want to develop a certified local area - a gathering of connected devotees who value your work as well as become faithful clients and supporters. This article investigates down-to-earth methodologies to assist you with moving past shallow commitment and constructing a flourishing local area on Instagram.\nThe Issue with Hashtag-Just Procedures:\nWhile hashtags are fundamental for discoverability, depending exclusively on them makes a value-based approach. You're projecting a wide net, expecting to get anyone with any interest. This frequently prompts brief likes and follows, yet not significant associations. Genuine people group building requires a more purposeful and individual methodology.\nBuilding a Real People group: Commonsense Advances:\nCharacterize Your Optimal Client: Before you can interface with your crowd, you want to know what their identity is. Make a nitty gritty profile of your optimal client - their socioeconomics, interests, trouble spots, and desires. This will illuminate your substance system and assist you with drawing in the right supporters.\nShare Your Story, in Addition to Your Items: Individuals associate with stories, not simply attempts to sell something. Share the \"why\" behind your work. What moves you? What difficulties have you had? Allow your character to radiate through and make an association with your crowd on a more profound level. In the background glimpses, work-in-progress shots, and individual tales can staggeringly lock in.\nConnect Legitimately: Don't simply communicate; participate in discussion. Answer remarks and DMs, seek clarification on some things and partake in applicable discussions inside your specialty. Show veritable interest in your supporters and their accounts. This two-way connection is significant for building connections.\nMake Intuitive Substance: Surveys, tests, interactive discussions, and difficulties are incredible ways of supporting commitment and cultivating a feeling of the local area. Urge your devotees to take part and offer their points of view. This increments communication as well as gives important bits of knowledge about your crowd's inclinations.\nTeam up with Others: Joining forces with different makers in your specialty can open your work to a more extensive crowd and acquaint you with new potential local area individuals. Joint efforts can take many structures, from joint giveaways and yell-outs to co-made content and live streams.\nOffer Selective Worth: Prize your dedicated adherents with restrictive substance, limits, or early admittance to new items. This causes them to feel esteemed and appreciated, fortifying their association with your image.\nBe Predictable and Patient: Building a veritable local area takes time and exertion. Try not to get deterred on the off chance that you don't get results for the time being. Remain reliable with your posting plan, connect genuinely, and keep on offering some benefit to your crowd.\nEnd:\nBuilding a flourishing local area on Instagram is a venture that takes care of over the long haul. By moving past hashtag-just systems and zeroing in on certifiable associations, you can make a steadfast following that upholds your imaginative business and turns into your greatest supporter. It's actually not necessary to focus on the quantity of supporters you have, but on the nature of the connections you construct.", "vote_count": 0, "comment_count": 0, "view_count": 38, "creation_date": "2025-07-10 10:45:04"}

This was supposed to be a system design round. The HR had informed me that the interview would consist of questions from OS, DBMS, Computer Science fundamentals, and OOPs\u2014essentially core subjects.\nFirstly, the interviewer joined 1.5 hours late. When he finally joined, he said, \u201cPlease allow me 2 minutes, I need to use the washroom.\u201d I politely said, \u201cGo ahead, sir.\u201d\nWhen he returned, the first thing he asked was, \u201cDo you know how a toilet flush works?\u201d\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t know the technical workings, but I had seen some Harpic advertisements on TV. So, I tried to answer by saying, \u201cSir, I think there's some rubber mechanism that holds water, and when we press the flush button, it releases the water.\u201d\nTo that, he bluntly replied, \u201cNahi aata to chup raho\u201d (If you don\u2019t know, keep your mouth shut).\nI understand that if I didn\u2019t know the answer, I should have stayed quiet\u2014but I thought giving a logical guess or intuition might show I'm trying.\nThen he asked me my favorite subject. I replied with a core subject that I enjoy. But he interrupted and said, \u201cNot from your core or engineering subjects.\u201d So I told him, \u201cSir, space fascinates me.\u201d\nHis counter-question was, \u201cIf you're stuck on a planet like Earth, how would you build a spaceship using only Earth\u2019s resources?\u201d\nI admitted honestly, \u201cSir, I don't know, I\u2019m from the CSE branch,\u201d especially since at the beginning of the interview he himself said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t know the answer, don\u2019t try to answer.\u201d\nNext, he shared his screen and showed 8 components. He asked me to build a steam engine using them. Again, I said, \u201cSorry sir, I don't know.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cNo worries, let\u2019s move to your technical skills.\u201d\nThen he asked me how a HashMap works in O(1) time complexity. Since I use Java, I explained how HashMaps work both before and after Java 8.\nAfter that, he simply said, your interview is over.\u201d\nThe next day, 6 students from our college reached the final round. 5 of them received offer letters and PPOs worth 27 LPA. I was the only one rejected.\nBelow is a summary of the interview process I cleared till Round 5. Thanks.\nNote to Juspay (or any senior officials who might see this):\nPlease ensure fairness and professionalism during interviews. This entire process spanned 2 months, and I dedicated myself wholeheartedly\u2014averaging only 5\u20136 hours of sleep daily. To be treated like this in the final round was deeply disheartening.

You need to find the maximum sum of the i-th node from the start and the i-th node from the end \u2014 i.e., max(first + last, second + second-last, ...).\nA note in the question mentioned solving this in O(1) space.\nHowever, all test cases passed with an O(n) space solution.\nFor the O(1) space solution, you can reverse the second half of the list and iterate from both ends.\nQ2\nYou're given:\nAn array of numerical strings of length n\nA bit string of length n\nEach step consists of:\nSelecting an element from the array if its corresponding bit is 1.\nModifying the bit string such that the i-th bit becomes 1 if the (i-1)-th bit is 1.\nYou need to perform m such steps and return the lexicographically largest string you can obtain.\nHonestly, the question was quite confusing. Took me a while to even understand what they were asking. The mathematical notation didn\u2019t help either.\nThe problem essentially boils down to selecting the largest number each step and updating the bit string accordingly.\nA naive solution works in O(m * n).\nI was able to pass 7/14 test cases, rest were TLE.\nA max heap may help optimize this further.\nIf anyone comes across this question online, please share \u2014 I\u2019d love to give it another try.\nDSA Round\nYou are given a tree where one node is on fire. You need to compute the time taken for all nodes to catch fire.\nIncluded 2 leadership principles (LPs).\nLLD Round\nDesign an e-commerce order notification system\nIncluded 2 LPs\nI didn\u2019t emphasize much on low-level details like class diagrams or DB schema. Despite that, the recruiter said the feedback was very positive.\nYour mileage may vary (YMMV).\nHLD Round\nDesign a car maintenance workshop management portal\nIncluded 2 LPs\nI was a bit flustered initially, but the interviewer was really kind and helped me gather my thoughts.\nBar Raiser Round\nAnother DSA problem + 2 LPs\nYou're given a set of tasks, each with:\nA profit\nA deadline (in time units)\nEach task takes 1 unit of time\nYou need to schedule tasks to maximize total profit.\nI fumbled quite a bit here. Started with a greedy approach, which the interviewer (politely) refuted.\nEventually came up with a DP solution, dry-ran it, and the interviewer seemed satisfied.\nBut honestly, the final solution I wrote wasn\u2019t correct.\nEvery interview included two LP questions. The questions themselves I don't remember, but I felt my responses were strong and to the point.\nCompensation\nSalary: \u20b942 LPA\nFirst year signing bonus: \u20b920 LPA\nSecond year signing bonus: \u20b916 LPA\nStock Bonus: 260 unit\nYear 1 TC: 45 + 45 + 2L ~ \u20b964L\nBenefits: Standard Amazon benefits -> Internet, Insurance, Transport, Sodexo, Gym", "vote_count": 12, "comment_count": 11, "view_count": 2846, "creation_date": "2025-07-04 18:09:01"}

Both got rescheduled because of unavailablity of Interviewer. Though disheartened at that moment this worked out in my favour. As i wouldn't have been able to clear the System design at that time.\nDSA Round (27th May)\nOnly 1 interview was scheduled on this day.\nFirst 10-15 mins went for the LP discussion. Recuriter informed me which 2 LP i have to prepare, so formed the STAR pattern answers for 8-10 questions.\n1st Question was variation of Max Island question, where we can change one 0 to 1 in the matrix and we need to find the largest island possible. Solved by finding all the components and greedily checked for each 0 what will the max island size if its changed to 1.\n2nd Questions was simple hashing based, don't remember the exact question but we only had a discussion on this no implementation as time was over.\nSelf Assesment - Hire/Strong Hire(Not sure because of the last question)\nLLD Round (17th June)\nThe round was initially scheduled for 10th but got rescheduled at the last moment.\nRecuriter informed the 2 LP i need to prepare, went with the same approach as last time.\nInitial 15 mins went in the LP discussion.\nI was asked to design the Issue management system(Different priority, Escalations, Wait Queue).\nOverall round went well and interviewer was satisfied with the solution.\nSelf Assesment - Strong Hire\nHLD Round (17th June)\nBecause of multiple rescheds i asked recruiter to schedule both rounds on same day if possible.\nRecuriter informed the 2 LP i need to prepare, went with the same approach as last time.\nI was asked to design Parking Lot system.\nSince this was a HLD round and the question seems more like an LLD, i got a bit confused and ended up discussing the LLD, interviewer was supportive and still asked meaningful questions as per LLD.\nLast 15 mins were utilised for LP, this time i was asked 4 questions based on the 2 LP i prepared.\nSelf Verdict - Lean Hire/Hire (Doubtfule because of LLD discussion in HLD)\nBar Raiser (23rd June)\nGot a mail after two days that a bar raiser is scheduled and it will be based on HLD. I expected the same because of the above reasons and was preparing for the same.\nFirst 10-15 mins went into LP discussion.\nI was asked to design Amazon Locker System. Next 40-45 mins went very well. I was designing it for the first time but bits and pieces which i learned from other systems all got utilised here. For eg : I learnt about proximity service in some other question and it just fit well in this problem as well.\nInterviewer asked few questions on the concurrency part and scaling, which i answered properly.\nOverall i was happy from my performance and interviewer also seems to be satisfied.\nSelf Verdict - Strong Hire (Mostly because i was proud of what i designed)\nGot the congratulation mail after 2 days.\nHad verbal offer discussion two days after.\nVerbal Offer:\nBase Pay - 43\nBonus - 15.3 + 12\nRSU - 210\nTotal First Year CTC - ~60\nI feel like the offer is a bit low ball.

{"id": "6907782", "title": "Why Are Some Companies Putting QA on a Pedestal Over Devs? It Feels Wrong.", "content": "I\u2019m going to throw this out there, and it might ruffle some feathers: in some workplaces, QA engineers seem to get more love, recognition, and sometimes even better perks than the developers who are grinding away to build the product from scratch. It\u2019s starting to feel off-balance, and honestly, a little unfair.\nLet me be crystal clear\u2014I have mad respect for QA engineers. I\u2019ve worked alongside some incredible QAs who\u2019ve caught critical bugs and saved our team from shipping disasters. They\u2019re vital to delivering solid software. But lately, at my current company (keeping it anonymous for obvious reasons), the way things are structured feels\u2026 well, lopsided.\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve noticed:\nEqual pay, unequal perks. At my company, QA and devs start with similar base salaries, which is fine. But then QA folks often snag bigger performance bonuses and extra goodies, like fully funded team outings that developers don\u2019t get invited to. Why the difference?\nQA gets the spotlight. I can\u2019t count how many times I\u2019ve seen QAs get public shout-outs in team chats or all-hands meetings for catching bugs. Meanwhile, when a developer ships a rock-solid feature or designs a system that prevents issues through smart architecture, it\u2019s just another day at the office. No applause, no mention.\nMore influence for QA. There are moments when QA teams have a louder voice in sprint planning, release decisions, or even what features take priority. Developers, on the other hand, often feel like order-takers\u2014just handed tickets and expected to churn out code without much room to weigh in or challenge the plan.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong\u2014catching bugs is crucial. But so is writing clean, thoughtful code that keeps bugs at bay in the first place. It\u2019s disheartening to feel like your work is undervalued just because it\u2019s less visible or doesn\u2019t come with a dramatic \u201csave the day\u201d moment.\nThis isn\u2019t about pitting QA against devs\u2014we\u2019re all on the same team, working toward the same goal. But when companies set things up in a way that feels like a zero-sum game, it\u2019s the developers who end up feeling like they\u2019re building the foundation while QA gets to cut the ribbon at the grand opening.\nIt\u2019s not just frustrating; it\u2019s demotivating. And over time, it\u2019s bound to hurt team morale and cohesion.\nHas anyone else seen this dynamic play out? Is it just my company, or is this becoming a broader trend? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts.", "vote_count": 2, "comment_count": 1, "view_count": 274, "creation_date": "2025-07-01 15:25:13"}

The interviewer looked a bit disappointed because I was not very familiar with these databases and had searched a lot of things.\nThe second part is to find bugs.\nTo be honest, this interviewer is a bit uncomfortable for me. Firstly, you need to identify the bug. At that time, he didn't give me 30 seconds to think. If I paused quietly for 5 seconds, he would interject and tell me what to do next. Sometimes when I'm about to say the next point I'm going to check, he interjects and says it, and it's exactly what I was about to say! I don't know if it's his personality, but I hope it doesn't make me look bad. Finally, he gave me a brief hint of where the bug was, and I immediately fixed it. Then he added a small issue, which I quickly resolved.\nThe third part is integration. Actually, it's just writing some POST request code for existing APIs, and there are many parts involved. I have finished four parts, but I don't have enough time. I don't know if they expect you to do more, but I have the most confidence in this round.

{"id": "6888844", "title": "\ud83d\udcac Discussion: I \u2764\ufe0f QUEUE Data Structure", "content": "\ud83d\udcac Discussion: I \u2764\ufe0f QUEUE Data Structure\nQueues are \ud83d\udd11 in many real-world and algorithmic scenarios. Here's why I'm obsessed with them:\n\ud83e\udde0 Introduction: Why QUEUE Matters\nIn the vast landscape of data structures, Queue stands out not for its complexity, but for its elegant simplicity and immense practical utility. Whether you\u2019re implementing algorithms, handling real-time systems, or optimizing workflows \u2014 queues are almost always involved.\nAt its heart, a queue follows the FIFO principle (First In, First Out) \u2014 meaning the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. This linear ordering mechanism is surprisingly powerful and forms the backbone of many real-world systems and classical computer science problems.\n\ud83d\udd39 Conceptual Foundation of Queue\nFIFO: This is the defining feature. Unlike stacks (which are LIFO), queues preserve the order of arrival.\nLinear Data Structure: Items are arranged in a linear order, moving from the front (\ud83d\udd3c) to the rear (\ud83d\udd3d).\nSingle Access Point at Each End:\nEnqueue (\ud83d\udd3d): Add item at the rear\nDequeue (\ud83d\udd3c): Remove item from the front\n\ud83d\udce6 Real-World Analogies\nQueues mimic many real-life processes:\n\ud83d\udecd\ufe0f People lining up at a billing counter\n\ud83d\udda8\ufe0f Print job queue in a printer spool\n\ud83d\udcde Call center waitlists\n\ud83c\udfae Multiplayer game matchmaking systems\n\ud83e\uddfe OS-level CPU scheduling\nIn each case, entities are processed in the exact order they arrive, ensuring fairness and predictability.\n\ud83e\udde9 Internal Structure\nQueues can be internally implemented in multiple ways:\n1. Array-Based Queue\nSimple to implement.\nHas a fixed size, so suffers from the \u201cfalse overflow\u201d problem (where space is unused at the front but not reused).\nPerformance is efficient for Enqueue/Dequeue if done carefully.\n2. Linked List-Based Queue\nUses dynamic memory allocation.\nNo fixed size limitation.\nEach node points to the next; enqueue at tail, dequeue from head.\nEfficient for dynamic workloads.\n3. Circular Queue\nSolves the overflow issue of array queues.\nUses modular arithmetic to wrap around.\nUseful in buffer management (e.g., circular buffers in audio processing or streaming).\n\ud83e\uddec Types of Queues\n\ud83d\udd38 1. Simple Queue\nBasic FIFO behavior.\nSupports Enqueue and Dequeue operations at opposite ends.\n\ud83d\udd38 2. Circular Queue\nThe last position is connected to the first.\nOptimizes space by reusing emptied spaces.\nCommon in buffering and streaming systems.\n\ud83d\udd38 3. Priority Queue\nElements are served based on priority, not just arrival time.\nImplemented typically using heaps.\nUsed in:\nDijkstra\u2019s Algorithm\nA* Search\nCPU scheduling (e.g., Shortest Job First)\n\ud83d\udd38 4. Deque (Double-Ended Queue)\nSupports insertion and deletion from both ends.\nCan work as both stack and queue.\nExtremely flexible.\nWidely used in sliding window problems and LRU cache implementations.\n\ud83d\udd38 5. Monotonic Queue\nSpecial form of queue that maintains elements in monotonic order.\nUsed in problems like:\nSliding Window Maximum\nMin/Max Queue\n\ud83d\udd38 6. Multiple Queues in an Array\nEfficient memory usage by storing multiple queues in a single array.\nUsed in OS memory or process scheduling.\n\u2699\ufe0f Internal Operations (Behind the Scenes)\nEach operation on a queue is governed by internal mechanisms:\n\u2705 Enqueue:\nSpace check \u2192 Is there room to add?\nPlace the element at the rear.\nMove rear pointer accordingly.\n\u2705 Dequeue:\nEmpty check \u2192 Is the queue non-empty?\nRemove element from front.\nMove front pointer forward.\nThese pointers (front/rear) are either indices (in arrays) or references (in linked lists). Proper pointer management is crucial to avoid errors like underflow (dequeue from empty) or overflow (enqueue into full fixed-size queue).\n\u23f1\ufe0f Time Complexity Summary\nOperation Time Complexity\nEnqueue O(1)\nDequeue O(1)\nPeek/Front O(1)\nSearch O(n)\nThis constant time complexity for main operations makes the queue ideal for time-critical applications.\n\ud83e\udde0 Classical Problems Using Queues*\nUnderstanding queues is incomplete without recognizing how foundational they are in algorithmic problem-solving:\n\ud83d\udd39 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)\nTraverses nodes level by level.\nQueue ensures correct exploration order.\n\ud83d\udd39 2. Shortest Path in Unweighted Graph\nBFS again \u2014 tracks levels through queue.\nQueue ensures minimal steps to reach target.\n\ud83d\udd39 3. Sliding Window Maximum\nUses deque to maintain max elements in O(n) time.\n\ud83d\udd39 4. First Non-Repeating Character in Stream\nQueue tracks character order.\nHashmap + Queue combo detects non-repeating elements efficiently.\n\ud83d\udd39 5. LRU Cache\nQueue + Hashmap or LinkedHashMap in Java.\nMaintains order of access for eviction strategy.\n\ud83d\udd39 6. Task Scheduling\nSimulates real OS scheduling.\nQueue manages which tasks are next.\n\ud83d\udcda Interview-Level Questions on Queues\nImplement a queue using stacks (\ud83e\udde0 tests understanding of both structures).\nReverse a queue using recursion (\ud83d\udcd0 conceptual depth).\nDesign a circular queue (\u2699\ufe0f focus on pointer wrapping).\nMax sliding window (\ud83d\udcca tests deque mastery).\nRotten oranges / Flood fill / Maze problems (\ud83d\udccd BFS + queue).\nThese questions are extremely common in FAANG-level interviews and platform contests (like on LeetCode, Codeforces, or CodeChef).\n\ud83e\udded Where Queues Truly Shine\nQueues might seem basic at first, but their power lies in their discipline and predictability. In multi-threaded systems, pipelines, simulations, and more, queues maintain the order, ensure fairness, and help prevent bottlenecks.\nThey also serve as building blocks for more complex structures:\nGraphs \u2192 BFS uses queues\nTrees \u2192 Level-order traversal\nHeaps \u2192 Priority Queues\nCaching \u2192 Deques (for LRU)\n\ud83e\uddea Pros and Cons\n\u2705 Advantages\nSimple and intuitive.\nConstant time operations.\nMultiple variants for flexible use.\nStrong real-world parallels.\n\u274c Disadvantages\nSearching is linear (O(n)).\nFixed-size queues (arrays) can waste space unless circular.\nPoor for scenarios needing random access.\n\ud83d\udd1a Conclusion\nThe Queue data structure is a paragon of elegance and efficiency. Its simplicity allows for fast operations, while its variants extend its utility into advanced algorithmic and system-level tasks. Whether you're a beginner learning data structures or an experienced developer optimizing concurrent systems, mastering queues is non-negotiable.\nIn short:\n\u201cQueue is not just a line \u2014 it\u2019s a philosophy of fairness, order, and efficiency.\u201d \ud83d\udd04\n\ud83d\udccc Join the discussion!\nWhat\u2019s your favorite queue-based problem?\nHave you ever used monotonic queues in competitive coding?\nWhich implementation do you prefer \u2014 array, linked list, or deque?\n\ud83d\udc47 Drop your thoughts below and let\u2019s make this thread the longest FIFO chain ever! \ud83d\ude04\n\u2795 FIFO (First In, First Out) \u2192 Simple yet powerful!\n\u23f3 Used in:\n\ud83d\udd04 BFS (Breadth-First Search)\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f CPU Scheduling\n\ud83d\udda8\ufe0f Print Queues\n\ud83c\udf10 Network Packet Routing\n\u267b\ufe0f Circular Queues = Space Optimization!\n\ud83d\udcda Implemented using arrays, linked lists, stacks, even two queues!\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f My Favorite Implementations:\nQueue q = new LinkedList<>(); // Java\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Implementations:\ncollections.deque() // Python (double-ended magic!)\nstd::queue q; // C++\nQueue = \u2728 elegant + essential \u2728\nWho else is on Team Queue? \ud83d\ude0d\n\ud83d\udc47 Share your favorite use-case!", "vote_count": 4, "comment_count": 2, "view_count": 125, "creation_date": "2025-06-26 15:33:14"}

I am an ICPC regionalist, have a 1700 Codeforces rating, and have solved more than 600+ questions on LeetCode (just for your reference on how good I am on a scale).\nBut even being from a Tier 1 college, since my branch is non-circuital, I wasn't allowed to sit for any IT placements, except one \u2014 Dassault Syst\u00e8mes. The interview lasted 6 hours, and I was the only candidate who had 3 rounds of interviews, unlike others. Everyone thought I would definitely make it, but ironically, they selected 10 others except me. The reason might be that I told the HR that I want to build something of my own in the next 10 years. That innocent answer cost me in this fake corporate world and I got rejected.\nNow, the fact is that most of my friends are from circuital branches, and my closest friend, who knows up to Linked Lists (and that too very little) and solved nearly 40\u201350 questions, recently got a PPO from Amazon. I still remember I was sitting beside him showing him answers during his interview.\nI\u2019ve observed that companies like Microsoft, AMEX, Amazon, NatWest, etc., recently have literally hired cheaters from on-campus. They have no idea how bad some of the selected candidates are.\nDuring the very end of placement season, I cracked a core company on-campus with an 8 LPA CTC. It was a mass hiring, and I had no other option so I applied. Even my family didn\u2019t want me to join service-based companies like TCS, Infosys, and I myself didn\u2019t want to go there either. I\u2019ve seen the struggle of the last 22 years, and I don\u2019t want to put all this knowledge into any mass-hiring company.\nYou think, would you switch into TCS, infosys with package of 3.3-7 LPA while you have a job of 60k per month in your own state.\nYou guys have even no idea.. how i have seen my life. The struggle i have put up is like hell. I did not even made any relationship thinking it might hamper my career and all those with so called GenZ and multiple relationships clubs bars are into MNCs. Now how would you belive god... huh ?? These are making me atheist. But Still I belive cosmos broke you before make you. Ok leave this.\nAnd if you're reading this, you should know how screwed up my college is. It follows a \"one student, one job\" policy \u2014 but not for circuital branches. WTF. I still remember that circuital students, especially girls (I\u2019m not gender-biased, I truly believe in feminism), were allowed multiple offers \u2014 BNY, AMEX, and still sat for Amazon, Apple, because there were more companies than students in their case. One girl even failed to reverse a string in a Salesforce interview \u2014 she was from CSE.\nNow, you might say it\u2019s my fault I didn\u2019t get into a circuital branch. For your reference, I got 97.8 percentile, and I am a pure general category student. My father had no clue about this EWS certificate, otherwise people being general with EWS got EE, EC, EI with 96.6 percentile at my college. Most CSE guys had 99.99 percentile, and all were from Bihar. Their percentile trend was like 6 percentile, 43 percentile, 99.99 percentile \u2014 how? Complete scam. They don\u2019t even know log(x), e^x, etc.\nNow I\u2019m messaging and cold emailing a lot on LinkedIn, but haven\u2019t gotten a single response. What should I do, guys?

Depth matters more than breadth.\nPrep leadership principles as much as DSA and LLD/System Design.\nInterviewer\u2019s engagement might vary \u2014 keep your calm and keep delivering quality.\nHappy to answer if you\u2019re preparing for Amazon or similar interviews.\nFeel free to DM or drop questions in the comments \ud83d\ude4c", "vote_count": 18, "comment_count": 13, "view_count": 2926, "creation_date": "2025-06-22 14:23:09"}

Will my current role or actual work affect my chances?\nAlso, with 3 YOE, can I apply for SDE 1 or SDE 2 roles?

{"id": "6858262", "title": "LinkedIn | Staff Software Engineer | Interview Experience | June 2025 | Offer ", "content": "Hi Leetcoders, I am posting my interview experience with LinkedIn India for the Staff Software Engineer role. For the Staff role, they have total of 6 rounds: 1 Screening and 5 online rounds\nHere is the breakdown of all the rounds:\nRound 1: Screening\nIn this round, Firstly, I was asked to give my detailed career intro along with leadership/project related questions:\nConflicting situations faced in any critical project\nImpactful project from which I was able to move out to other project with minimal disruption\nFew follow-ups were there and this discussion lasted for around 20 mins\nThen, I got a LC Hard DSA question : https://leetcode.com/problems/max-stack/\nI discussed 2-3 most optimal approaches and the interviewer agreed on one of the approaches to code it for all the helper methods along with discussion on Space and Time Complexity. Also, I was asked to dry run on a pre-written TC.\nRating : Strong Hire\nRound 2: DSA 1: Staff Coding - Apps\nQ1: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring\nThe problem was extended to a condition when the source string is wrapped around.\nQ2: Shortest path between LinkedIn connections. An adjacency list is given, a source and a target. Find the connection distance between source and target. Print the path as well.\nI discussed the optimal solution : Bi-directional BFS and coded for the same.\nRating : Strong Hire\nRound 3: DSA 2: Staff Coding & Algorithms 2\nQ1: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder\nI gave the most optimized O(M*N) approach inspired by the below link:\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/submissions/1595132398\nQ2: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance-ii\nGave the optimal 2-pointer approach.\nExtension: For the scenario if one string's occurences are less than other, used binary search for the more frequent string.\nRating : Strong Hire\nRound 4: System Design\nInitially, this round started with project and leadership based questions. Don't remember the exact questions, Apologies.\nNext, the interviewer covered the most complex project I recently led and covered about the security aspects and challenges faced. There were multiple follow-ups to understand my roles and responsibilities working as a tech lead.\nNext, I was given the below system design problem:\nDesign a flexible in-memory cache with customizable capacity and eviction policies.\nThe cache should allow users to define:\nCapacity: Specify how much data the cache can hold based on memory resources and data size.\nEviction Policy: Choose strategies for removing items when the cache is full, such as Least Recently Used (LRU) or Lowest Priority.\nThis flexibility ensures the cache can be tailored to meet specific requirements, balancing resource usage and performance.\nOnce the LLD created was agreed with the interviewer, it was extended from HLD perspective for multiple nodes in distributed system setup covering all the challenges and other adhoc scenarios like hot key issue for a write-heavy setup. Also, discussion went around few Redis related internals.\nRating : Hire\nRound 5: Craftsmanship\nThis is mostly a behavioral based round for Staff role. It covered 8-10 scenario questions with internal follow ups. Questions were as follows:\n-> How do you define a quality product/system?\n-> Describe your strategy regarding code reviews\n-> Talk about a project that had many junior engineers and how I kept the project quality high/ If your team keeps growing and you get more junior engineers, what do you do?\n-> As a hypothetical situation, Imagine you join LinkedIn on a massive team that owns a legacy application. The application lacks adequate testing and monitoring and has slow response times. Consumers complain about this. Deployment of the application often contains bugs. What efforts would you do as a Staff SWE?\n-> Rank the following in terms of priority: bugs, no testing, no monitoring, slowness. What do you tackle first? How do you eventually turn this into micro services?\n-> What do you look for when determining the success of a service?\n-> What are your principles of mentorship? How do you manage technical and non-technical mentorship?\n-> Talk about a time where you helped grow engineers\n-> Few questions which were aligning with the LinkedIn values. Don't remember the exact questions.\nNote: Please be well-versed about Linkedin values.\nRating : Strong Hire\nRound 6: Host Manager\nThis round started with an elaborate introduction of both me and the interviewer.\nQuestions were as follows:\nTalk in detail about the most complex and challenging project I led in the recent times which had a very large scale. I framed my answer step-by-step as follows (along with few follow-ups from the HM):\n-> Team and My role\n-> Customer Problem & Business impact\n-> Key architectural decisions led/taken by me\n-> Biggest challenges faced and how did I overcome\n-> How did I maintain timely execution of the project\n-> Changes in reqs/unexpected blockers\n-> Ensuring alignment with stakeholders\nWhy looking for change? Why LinkedIn?\nDescribe a situation where you showed operational excellence.\nDescribe a situation where you suggested improvements in the project which other engineers in the team could leverage from.\nThen at the end, he threw a HLD problem for designing a LinkedIn internal notification system which can handle a very large scale.\nThere were few cross-questions regarding the different internal microservices and Kafka being used for async handling.\nThis just had 10-15 mins at the end. Luckily, I was able to create the HLD diagram covering all the components.\nVerdict : Selected for the staff role after a week.\nCompensation details :\nBase salary: 88 LPA\nTarget bonus : 13.2 LPA (min 15%)\nPF : 4.25 LPA\nRSU: 350k for 4 years (75.5 LPA)\nRelocation bonus/services: ~ 5-7 L\nNet CTC per year : 1.85 Cr PA (++ unlimited LinkedIn Perks)\nYOE : 10\nCurrent CTC : 63 LPA (Microsoft : Senior SWE)\nHad another competing offers from Salesforce and Atlassian (~1.4 Cr PA), but finally I accepted the LinkedIn offer due to a better role and compensation.\nThanks to the Leetcode community for helping during my preparation and it's my time to give back to the community.

Here's a clear comparison:\n\ud83d\udd39 1. Definition\nFeature RSU ESOP\nWhat it is A promise to give you company shares (or equivalent value) after a vesting period. A right to buy company shares at a fixed price (called strike price) after a vesting period.\n\ud83d\udd39 2. Ownership & Purchase\nFeature RSU ESOP\nOwnership You receive shares for free once they vest (you don't need to pay). You have to exercise (buy) the shares at the strike price once they vest.\nCost to Employee \u20b90 (free on vesting) You pay the exercise price, which may be lower than the current market price.\n\ud83d\udd39 3. Vesting\nFeature RSU ESOP\nVesting Schedule Yes \u2013 usually over 3\u20134 years Yes \u2013 usually over 3\u20134 years\n\ud83d\udd39 4. Taxation (India)\nEvent RSU ESOP\nAt Vesting Taxed as perquisite income (salary), based on market value. Not taxed.\nAt Exercise N/A (no exercise) Taxed as perquisite income, on the difference between market value and strike price.\nAt Sale Capital gains tax on selling shares Capital gains tax on selling shares\n\ud83d\udd39 5. Risk to Employee\nFeature RSU ESOP\nRisk Lower \u2013 shares are given without payment Higher \u2013 you pay to buy, but the price may fall later\n\ud83d\udd39 6. Best For\nFeature RSU ESOP\nSuited for Later-stage or public companies with stable valuation Startups and early-stage companies offering upside potential\n\ud83d\udd39 Example\nRSU: You are granted 100 RSUs. After 1 year, 25 RSUs vest. You don\u2019t pay anything, but you are taxed on the market value of those 25 shares as income.\nESOP: You are granted 100 options at a strike price of \u20b950. After 1 year, 25 options vest. You can choose to buy them for \u20b950 each. If the market price is \u20b9200, you pay \u20b950 per share and are taxed on \u20b9150 per share as income.\n\u2705 Summary\nCriteria RSU ESOP\nFree shares \u2705 \u274c\nNeed to buy shares \u274c \u2705\nTaxed at vesting \u2705 \u274c\nTaxed at exercise \u274c \u2705\nCommon in MNCs, public companies Startups, early-stage companies\nI thought this is important to understand.so I shared it from ChatGPT so that others might also benefit.

Including that internship and my current role, I now have over 1 year of industry experience.\nTech Stack & Focus\nMy primary focus is on backend development, and I\u2019ve mostly worked with the following technologies:\nTech Stack: C++, C, JavaScript, TypeScript, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, Node.js, Express, React.js\nIn my current job, I mainly work on backend features, API development, and integrations using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and MySQL.\nWhy I\u2019m Posting\nI aspire to join a well\u2011paying company (\u20b9100,000+/month) that offers both technical growth and career progression. To bridge the gap between where I am and where I want to be, I need to deepen my understanding of advanced backend concepts and system design.\nI\u2019d greatly appreciate guidance on:\nWhat should I learn beyond basic CRUD APIs?\nShould I start with Low-Level Design (LLD), High-Level Design (HLD), or full System Design? Any good resources for design \u2013 courses, articles, or YouTube channels?\nWhich core backend concepts should I go deep into (e.g., distributed systems, scalability, caching, queues, microservices, API gateways, NGINX)? What are some good resources or real-world project ideas to strengthen these concepts?\nWhere can I find and practice backend/system design interview-type questions?\nAny personal experiences, roadmaps, or cheat-sheets that helped you grow faster?\nI\u2019m highly motivated to increase my earnings, and for that, I\u2019m ready to learn anything needed to grow technically and professionally. Right now, I\u2019m fully willing to invest extra time\u2014even 10+ hours a day if required\u2014to upskill and take on challenging roles.

The process consisted of three elimination based rounds \u2014 two technical rounds followed by a hiring manager round.\nRound 1 (Medium to Hard Level):\nThe interview began with a brief introduction, and then the interviewer directly moved into problem-solving. The first question was to find the maximum element in a binary tree. Once I solved that, she followed up with another dsa problem similar to Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum. I was able to solve both problems in about 30 minutes, so she gave me another question similar to Asteroid Collision .\nRound 2 (Hard Level):\nThis round was conducted by a senior engineer and started off unexpectedly with questions from Operating System concepts. I was asked to explain topics like defragmentation, thrashing, and other memory management concepts, there were questions from virtual memory as well. The interviewer deep-dived into each concept. Then we moved into C++, where I was asked about the auto storage class, and to explain virtual functions with an example and describe their use case. After the theory part, I was given a dsa problem \u2014 a twisted version of the LRU Cache. I had to explain my logic and write pseudo-code.The interviewer went through it in detail and asked follow-up questions on each part of my implementation. Finally, I was given a problem similar to Reverse Nodes in K Group . We were short on time, so I explained my approach and wrote the pseudo-code.\nRound 3 (Medium Level):\nThe hiring manager started by asking how the previous rounds went and then transitioned into a resume-based discussion. I was asked to explain the projects I had worked on at my previous organization, the role I played, and how I contributed to runtime improvements through my code changes. The conversation then shifted to object-oriented design. I was asked to explain the Singleton class, how to ensure thread safety in its implementation, and to write the code for it. This was followed by a deep-dive discussion on abstraction, virtual classes, vtable, and vptr.\nHope this helps with your preparation!

I\u2019m reaching out to gather some perspectives as I\u2019m a bit uncertain about whether to accept the offer.\nBackground:\nI have close to 4 years of experience working at a product-based startup.\nCurrent Company \u2013 Pros:\nDecent compensation and work-life balance\nWork from office (WFO) with flexible hours\nWork from home (WFH) is allowed when requested upto 4 in a month(though this flexibility is gradually being reduced)\nCurrent Company \u2013 Cons:\nLearning and growth have become stagnant\nFrequent and unclear policy changes\nSilent layoffs are happening \u2014 feels like a ticking time bomb\nCompensation isn't growing at a satisfying pace + have been there for 4 years\nNew Offer \u2013 Pros:\nApproximately a 25% hike in the cash component\nSteeper learning curve\nThe company appears to be growing steadily\nNew Offer \u2013 Cons:\nStrict 5-day WFO with fixed entry hours\nLong working hours (10\u201311 hours/day), with increased pressure towards the end of the week to complete the deadlines\nHeavy workload, resulting in almost no work-life balance\nI noticed on LinkedIn that the tech team is relatively small (around 8\u20139 backend engineers), and most of them appear to have less experience than me. While I\u2019m not judging, I do feel this might limit opportunities to learn from more experienced peers, which is something I value at this stage in my career.\nMy Dilemma:\nShould I put in my papers at the current company and treat this startup offer as a backup in case I don't land something better soon? Or should I stay put until I get an offer that\u2019s more aligned with my expectations? I'm prioritizing both learning and mental health.\nI\u2019d genuinely appreciate your advice and insights. I\u2019m sure many of you have been through similar crossroads and can relate to the confusion.\nThanks in advance!", "vote_count": 2, "comment_count": 8, "view_count": 1570, "creation_date": "2025-06-03 04:44:22"}

The entire process lasted about 6 months (Application submission in December 2024, Offer in June 2025)\n\ud83e\udde0 Online Assessment (OA)\nDate: Jan 2025\nPlatform: HackerRank\nDuration: 3-4 hours\nStructure:\nPart 1: 2 DSA questions, Medium Difficulty\nPart 2: Work Simulation, Leadership Principles\nCoding Questions:\nGreedy based medium difficulty question\nSimulation type tree question, got MLE on recursive solution, passed all test cases on iterative solution.\nMy Approach:\nSolved both the DSA questions in under 45 mins, and then took the rest of the time to solve leadership and work simulation parts.\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Round 1 \u2013 Technical Interview (DSA)\nDate: March 2025\nDuration: ~60 minutes\nPlatform: Amazon Chime\nNote: This round was re-scheduled two times, both the time interviewers did not show up :( .\nQuestions:\nProblem 1: https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/description/\nHad Solved this problem before, came with an optimal solution in 15-20 mins.\nProblem 2: Similar to : https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/description/\nHard difficulty, came with the code for a semi-optimal solution, gave an approach in the end for a optimal solution.\nLeadership Questions and Questions about my current company.\n\ud83d\udcbb Round 2 \u2013 Technical Interview (DSA)\nDate: May 2025\nDuration: ~75 minutes\nPlatform: Amazon Chime\nNote: Got a mail after one week after round-1 stating that I cleared the previous round and will have a second round. Later I got the schedule, but this is where I occurred alot of issues. I had this round re-scheduled a total of 7 times, with most of the times interviewer simply did not show up without any prior communication. Really lost hope and in the end, but atlast my interview did happen.\nQuestions:\nProblem 1 : https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/description/\nCame up with a solution in under 15-20mins, medium dificulty.\nProblem 2: Similar to : https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/\nHard Difficulty (for me), Although I had solved this prior, I had no idea for the optimal solution. I tried to come up with an optimal approach, came up with a solution, but did not have the time left to code. Interviewer was mildly satisfied.\nStandard LP questions\n\ud83e\udd1d Round 3 \u2013 Bar Raiser (Behavioral + LP + DSA)\nDate: May 2025\nDuration: ~60 minutes\nPlatform: Amazon Chime\nNote : Got a mail after a week of round-2 that i have cleared the round, and they are acitvely working on scheduling my round -3. Got a call from Loop scheduler 1.5 weeks after for the round to be scheduled on Saturday, I immediately agreed (as I had 0 holidays left due Round-2 being re-scheduled so many times), and I got the mail for schedule. Suprisingly there were two interviewers, one really senior, one SDE-2.\nOne more thing, this specific mail did not have live code link, thus I was not expecting a DSA question, but in the interview it was asked.\nFormat:\n30 mins LP Questions.\n30 mins DSA Question\nQuestions:\nLeadership Principles\nTell me about a time you got feedback\nTell me about a time you faced critical issues\nTell me about a time you went beyond your task/job\nFollow ups on all\nDSA\nProblem : https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-nice-subarrays/description/\nCame up with a 2-pass approach, interviewer was satisfied enough, medium difficulty.\nCurrent Package\nCTC : 7 LPA\nYOE : 9 Months\n\ud83d\udcec Offer\nRole: SDE-1\nLocation: Bengaluru\nDate : June 2025\nPackage :\nBase Pay : 19,17,000\nSign-on Bonus Year 1 (INR): 6,47,000\nSign-on Bonus Year 2 (INR) :5,18,000\nRestricted Stock Unit Value (RSU) (4 years)(INR):15,56,000\nTotal CTC : 48 L +\nNote: Recieved the offer after almost 2.5 weeks after the the last round, I was constantly mailing the loop scheduler back and in the end the recruiter finally called me.\nTips (Important)\nSolve standard DSA sheets, interview questions are mostly asked around these with most of them being medium difficulty.\nDont wait for the reply, simply mail the loop scheduler mail back for an update, my loop mail thread was around 40 mails.\nFor LP questions, prepare a list of 30-40 questions, you can easily find on leetcode, and run a deep research query on chatgpt along with your resume, get STAR based answers, and have follow up answers also prepared.\nFinal Thoughts:\nI am really grateful to recieve this offer and finally my hardwork did pay off. I hope this post will help other people around who are in the process, and feel like they stuck in the re-scheduling loop.\nFeel free to ask questions in the comments.

{"id": "6764684", "title": "Meta Interview to Offer For SWE E4", "content": "Hello all. During my time interviewing, I read a lot of other peoples' posts here to give me encouragement. I hope this post does the same for others. The total timeline from recruitment to signing was 6 months. My story is really long to help those who need details. Best of luck to everyone. Don't give up!\nMy Background\nI have 6 years of experience at Amazon and two prior internships.\nRecruitment\nI met a meta recruiter at Grace Hopper, but generally Meta, Google, and other FAANG companies email or linkedin message me. I applied after Grace Hopper in November and heard back in 2 weeks. I scheduled my phone screen for January since I planned to work full time until I got an offer.\nPhone Screen\nStudying\nI prepared for 2 months for 20 hours a week. I went over the top 150 meta tagged questions 2-3 times. I looked at multiple optimal solutions. I paid for 1 mock interview with an ex-meta engineer and did multiple practice rounds for free on Exponent with strangers.\nInterview\nOn the phone screen day, both questions were from the top 50 meta tagged questions. I got strong feedback the next day and moved onto the onsite.\nOnsite\nMy system design was infra. I have experience in both infra and product work. I took off about 3 2 week vacations to study 40 hours a week. When I was working, I study 20 hours a week.\nStudying\nSystem Design\nMy onsite was in April because I needed a lot of time to prepare for the system design because I never had a system design interview before. I was hired at Amazon straight from college. For system design I read Alex Xu's book, although it was outdated. Then I did every problem on Hello Interview 2-3 times and reviewed their youtube videos and written guides 2-3 times. TBH there are more online resources for product than infra questions on Hello Interview. I scheduled a paid system design mock with an ex-meta engineer. This process took about 5 weeks.\nLeetcode\nThen I went over the top 150 meta tagged coding questions over and over again until I could do all of them in 10-15 mins. I made sure I spoke outloud in the meta format of asking clarifying questions, explaining my plan, confirming the plan was valid, explaining trade offs if there were multiple good solutions, saying the time and space complexity, coding, and going through at least 1 example. The important part for me was doing all of this in 10 minutes if I could. I memorized the solutions, but also made sure I could explain every line of code.\nMy next step was to make sure I could do variants. I watched all of the variants from this channel https://www.youtube.com/@CodingWithMinmer and then solved them myself. I did some of them twice if they were harder.\nI redid all the hard meta tagged top 150 questions one more time 2 days before the interview. This took me 6 weeks.\nBehavioral\nI collected previously asked meta behavioral questions from hello interview and general behavioral questions (about 30-40 questions). I practiced speaking all of them.\nThen I created a list of 5-6 questions for each of the five core meta pillars.\nResolving Conflict\nGrowing Continuously\nEmbracing Ambiguity\nDriving Results\nCommunicating Effectively\nI outlined 10 different work examples. Then I wrote a story for each of the questions based on those work examples. Then I got friends to ask me the same questions over and over again. At first I took too long to answer a question (7 minutes) and I wasn't clear with the STAR technique. After 8-10 rounds of 5 questions, I felt like I had my examples memorized and each took 3 minutes to get all elements of star.\nThis took about 1 week.\nFinal Review\nFor the last 2 weeks or so, I practiced interviewing. I did online interviews on Exponent for system design, leetcode, and behavioral. It was really hit or miss who I got on the site. So I stopped after 1 week and just practiced with a friend each day.\nInterview\nBehavorial\nI got a nice interviewer who asked standard interview questions. Some weren't exactly like the questions I had practiced, but I just picked 1 of the 10 examples I had and fitted it to the question. Interviewer was laughing and said he wanted to see me in the office sometime.\nSystem Design\nI was thrown off guard because I didn't get one of the questions on the Hello Interview Guides. Note this question was on discussion pages of Hello Interview, but was ranked low.\nI thought I could use top-k videos for this problem, but my interviewer said since he only asked me for 1 game that I was going too far. I scaled it back and went more like the leetcode leader board with a Redis sorted set and he was happy. I wanted to try for E5 even though my years put me at E4. I wasn't picked for E5 because I had help.\nLeetCode I\nI got two variants of top 100 meta tagged questions. I highly recommend people review CodingWithMinmer if you have an onsite. It saved me. Both of them were from CodingWithMinmer's channel although slightly different (but not in a meaningful way). The second variant, I didn't remember as well, so I got stuck at the coding, but made it out okay because I had so much time saved from the first question.\nLeetCode II\nI got another two variants. One from CodingWithMinmer and the other was a top meta tagged; but to return the list instead of the size. I finished both in 10 minutes. The only problem was that for the first one I forgot the 0 case because Minmer did only positive numbers. I got so nervous and my brain couldn't think about how to solve it. The interviewer kindly reminded me that I had 30 minutes to solve this one case and to take a breath. She was really nice and that helped me calm down enough to finish the case.\nResult:\nMy recruiter called me 4 hours after my final interview and said my feedback was really strong. I passed E4, but because for system design I got help, I didn't get E5.\nTeam Matching\nThis was the worst part. I live in NYC and I can't move. NYC is really hard to team match. It took me 5 weeks. I heard nothing for 4 weeks. I joined a Discord of other meta TM candidates to get advice. I saw some people had been waiting months. I heard that a good idea is to message people on Linkedin or get a friend in Meta to ping HMs. I did both. After my friend spammed HMs, I got matched the same day.\nNegotiation\nI didn't have any other offers from other companies. I was too busy to interview for more places, but my Amazon salary is near the top of my level. My Amazon salary got me probably the highest comp that Meta was offering for E4 right now from what I saw on the discord channel. It is nothing like 2021, but it is higher than Amazon so I took it.\nMy NYC Amazon Salary: 190K base/300K RSU for 3 years\nMy NYC Meta: 193k base/450K RSU for 4 years/35K bonus/15% yearly rate bonus\nSummary\nI used to love my teams at Amazon, which is why I stayed so long. However, things have changed and management has become more toxic as my teams grew. RTO5, salary, and poor treatment of my team is what made me leave. I hope for better treatment from my new team. I hope people also find themselves relating to this too and find that my post gave them courage to fight for what they deserve (to be treated like a human) at work. At the end of the day the hiring process is all about luck. I got lucky to have nice interviewers. Don't be too hard on yourselves as some things are out of our control. I wish everyone else luck on their journeys", "vote_count": 16, "comment_count": 4, "view_count": 1764, "creation_date": "2025-05-20 23:43:23"}

{"id": "6755409", "title": "Microsoft Interview experience - Frontend SDE 2(L62) - Hyderabad(INDIA)", "content": "My Microsoft Interview Experience \u2013 The Most Engaging Interview of My Career\nI've 6+ years of experience in Web and mobile development, specifically in React and React native. I\u2019ve participated in over 100 interviews across 30+ companies, but without a doubt, the most engaging and fulfilling experience was with Microsoft. The entire process felt less like a formal assessment and more like a thoughtful, intellectually stimulating conversation\u2014just like the ones I usually have with my colleagues during problem-solving discussions.\n\ud83d\udccc Application Process\nI applied through the official Microsoft Careers page. About a week later, I received a call from the HR representative, who walked me through the entire interview process. They clearly outlined the structure:\nTotal Rounds: 5\nOnline Codility DSA Round\nDSA Interview\nSystem Design Round 1\nSystem Design Round 2\nHiring Manager Round\nThe HR also mentioned that the interviews were partially eliminative. If I cleared the online assessment, I\u2019d be expected to take the next three technical rounds on the same day, with the fourth round contingent on clearing rounds 2 and 3.\n\ud83d\udd39 Round 1 \u2013 Codility Online DSA Round\nThis was a timed coding round hosted on Codility. I received 2 problems:\nI fully solved one problem, passing all test cases.\nI was only able to partially solve the second one.\n\ud83d\udd0d Observations:\nEnsure you solve at least one problem completely and make a good attempt on the second.\n\u2705 Result: Cleared the cutoff\nReceived a call from the recruiter confirming progression to the next round.\n\ud83d\udd39 Round 2 \u2013 Data Structures & Algorithms\nThis round was a live coding session with an engineer.\nI was asked to solve a medium-level DSA problem.\nI began with a brute-force approach, which I clearly explained.\nThe interviewer nudged me toward optimization. I was able to do it.\nThen again interviewer asked me to optimise it further which partially I did it but couldn't do it further and interviewer helped me to go through it with full explanation of code.\nNext, I was asked a situational/behavioral question:\n\"Tell me about a time when you were discussing an approach with your team, and later realized your suggestion wasn\u2019t the best. How did you handle it?\"\nI structured my response using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result), and the interviewer seemed satisfied.\n\ud83d\udd0d Observations:\nBe expressive and communicate your thought process clearly.\nStart with a brute-force solution quickly, then improve.\nPrioritize clean, bug-free code.\nPrepare real-life stories for behavioral questions.\n\ud83d\udd39 Round 3 \u2013 System Design: Design Airbnb\nThis round focused on high-level system design. I used the RADIO framework:\nRequirements gathering\nArchitecture (High-Level Design)\nData modeling\nInterface (API Design)\nOptimizations\nHowever, the interviewer redirected the discussion to a more specific concurrency problem:\n\"How would you handle scenarios where multiple users try to book the same room via different platforms?\"\nScenarios discussed:\nSame room, same platform\nSame room, different platforms\nDifferent rooms, same platform\nDifferent rooms, different platforms\nPlatforms mentioned: Airbnb, MakeMyTrip, Booking.com, Agoda\nWe explored each case in detail, discussed component interactions, and designed solutions to handle consistency and concurrency.\n\ud83d\udd0d Observations:\nBe flexible in your approach\u2014expect the design discussion to evolve.\nVisualize your solution (block diagrams help!).\nUnderstand edge cases, particularly around consistency and race conditions.\n\ud83d\udd39 Round 4 \u2013 System Design Discussion\nThis round was the most conversational and interactive of them all. The interviewer\u2019s enthusiasm made the session truly enjoyable.\n\ud83e\udde0 Problem Statement:\n\"You are given multiple APIs and need to render the data in an infinite scroll list. How would you design it?\"\nAdditionally:\n\"If a Product Manager presented you with this problem, what follow-up questions would you ask?\"\nI focused on gathering clarity by asking:\nWhat kind of data will each API return?\nAre the data formats consistent?\nWill we need filtering/sorting?\nCan the number of APIs vary dynamically?\nWhat should we show if all APIs fail?\nHow should error messages be handled?\nWe explored all scenarios thoroughly, especially around UX and edge case handling.\n\ud83d\udd0d Observations:\nStrong communication and asking the right questions matter.\nUnderstand failure cases and user impact.\nThe interviewer was highly experienced (10+ years), and the depth of discussion reflected that.\n\ud83d\udd39 Round 5 \u2013 Hiring Manager Round\nThis round had two components:\nA basic React coding task\nSeveral behavioral and situational questions\nThe coding task was simple, but the focus was on:\nCode readability\nCommunication\nThe behavioral questions were based on real-world scenarios, most of which I had faced during my career. I answered honestly\u2014even admitting when I hadn\u2019t encountered certain situations.\n\ud83d\udd0d Observations:\nThis round evaluates your problem-solving approach and communication.\nBe honest\u2014don\u2019t fabricate experiences.\nKeep your stories authentic and professional.\n\u2705 Final Verdict: Selected\nI received the offer letter one week later. \ud83c\udf89\n\ud83d\udcac What I Loved About the Experience:\nInterviewers were highly engaging, knowledgeable, and respectful.\nConversations felt collaborative rather than evaluative.\nI was encouraged to think deeply and communicate effectively.\n\u2728 Key Takeaways\nMicrosoft emphasizes clarity of thought, structured problem-solving, and collaborative communication.\nSystem design isn\u2019t just about architecture\u2014it\u2019s about understanding real-world complexity and user scenarios.\nBehavioral questions matter as much as technical ones.\nBeing genuine and prepared makes a significant difference.\nIf you're preparing for Microsoft or any top-tier company, I hope this detailed breakdown helps you navigate the journey better.

{"id": "6717462", "title": "Top 10 System Design Interview Mistakes", "content": "System design rounds often carry significant weight in onsite loops for mid- to senior-level roles. Even at SDE-1, interviewers want to see thoughtful trade-offs and clear architecture thinking. Avoiding these common pitfalls can dramatically improve your chances.\n1. Skipping Requirement Clarification\nMistake: Jumping straight into drawing diagrams.\nWhy It\u2019s Bad: You might build the wrong system.\nFix: Spend 2\u20133 minutes confirming functional (throughput, latency) and non\u2010functional (SLAs, scale) requirements. Ask questions like:\n\u201cWhat\u2019s our target QPS?\u201d\n\u201cHow consistent must reads be?\u201d\n2. Over-Engineering from the Start\nMistake: Designing full microservices before tackling basics.\nWhy It\u2019s Bad: You\u2019ll run out of time and confuse the interviewer.\nFix: First propose a simple monolith or single\u2010service solution. Then iterate:\nSingle API server + relational DB\nAdd caching layer\nIntroduce partitioning or sharding\n3. Neglecting Data Modeling\nMistake: Ignoring how data is stored\u2014jumping straight to load balancers.\nWhy It\u2019s Bad: You can\u2019t discuss partition keys or index strategies later.\nFix: Sketch your database schema early. Discuss:\nTable design (primary keys, foreign keys)\nIndexes vs. full\u2010text search\nSQL vs. NoSQL trade-offs\n4. Failing to Address Failure Modes\nMistake: Assuming every component is 100% available.\nWhy It\u2019s Bad: Real systems fail; you need resilience.\nFix: For each component, ask \u201cWhat if it fails?\u201d Then propose:\nCircuit breakers\nRetry policies with exponential backoff\nDead-letter queues\n5. Ignoring Security & Privacy\nMistake: Leaving out authentication, authorization, or data encryption.\nWhy It\u2019s Bad: Security is non-negotiable in interviews and production.\nFix: Explicitly call out:\nOAuth or token\u2010based auth flow\nTLS for data in transit\nEncryption at rest\n6. Overlooking Monitoring & Metrics\nMistake: Finishing the design without thinking about observability.\nWhy It\u2019s Bad: You can\u2019t ensure SLAs without monitoring.\nFix: Propose metrics and dashboards:\nQPS, latency percentiles (p95/p99)\nError rates, number of timeouts\nHealth checks and alerting\n7. Rushing Through Caching Strategies\nMistake: Saying \u201cwe\u2019ll cache\u201d without specifying patterns.\nWhy It\u2019s Bad: Interviewers want depth on cache invalidation, cache stampede.\nFix: Describe:\nCache-aside vs. write-through vs. write-back\nExpiration policies (TTL, LRU)\nStampede protection (mutex, request coalescing)\n8. Forgetting Data Consistency Models\nMistake: Assuming strong consistency everywhere.\nWhy It\u2019s Bad: You might block high-throughput use cases unnecessarily.\nFix: Discuss consistency trade-offs:\nStrong vs. eventual consistency\nWhen read-your-writes or monotonic reads matter\nUse cases for quorum reads/writes\n9. Not Time-Boxing Your Discussion\nMistake: Spending the entire time on one component.\nWhy It\u2019s Bad: You might never cover scaling, monitoring, or failover.\nFix: Allocate rough time:\n5 min requirements\n10 min high-level design\n10 min deep dive (pick one component)\n5 min scaling, monitoring, wrap-up\n10. Skipping Trade-Off Conversations\nMistake: Presenting a single \u201cperfect\u201d solution.\nWhy It\u2019s Bad: Interviewers want to see how you evaluate options.\nFix: For each key decision, explicitly compare alternatives:\nSQL vs. NoSQL: latency vs. consistency\nMonolith vs. microservices: simplicity vs. maintainability\nCDN vs. origin server: cost vs. performance\nFinal Tips\nPractice End-to-End: Design a service start to finish in 20 minutes on a whiteboard or Excalidraw.\nGet Feedback: Record your mock interviews and note missing sections.\nStay Conversational: Talk through assumptions and trade-offs as you draw.", "vote_count": 11, "comment_count": 0, "view_count": 645, "creation_date": "2025-05-05 16:07:06"}

One thing to know about Google interviews: they often keep questions vague on purpose. Not to confuse you, but to observe how well you communicate, how you break down problems, and how deeply you think.\n\ud83d\udccc Golden Rule for Google Interviews:\nRead the problem multiple times.\nAsk clarifying questions.\nDon\u2019t rush into coding.\nThey want clean, well-thought-out solutions \u2014 not quick fixes.\nMy telephonic round had two tree-based questions:\nOne was centered on Inorder Traversal.\nThe other seemed like a follow-up, but turned out to be completely independent \u2014 testing if I could recognize the difference and push back if needed.\nI proposed alternate and optimized solutions to both \u2014 and that helped me stand out.\nA week later, I got a call from HR: I passed! They asked for my availability for onsite interviews \u2014 five potential days. I agreed. My interviews were scheduled on four consecutive days, which was incredibly stressful.\nIn the week leading up, I was grinding hard on everything I ever struggled with:\nKMP, Convex Hull, Segment Trees, and more. I was mentally exhausted, constantly questioning if I\u2019d even make it.\nOnsite Round 1\nA two-pointer problem with precomputation, related to subarray sums.\nOnsite Round 2\nA recursive tree problem involving contiguous and isolated identical values.\nOnsite Round 3\nThe interviewer didn\u2019t show up, so it got postponed a week.\nWhen it finally happened, it was a stack-based question involving bracket matching and equation simplification.\nGoogliness Round\nFocused on behavioral aspects \u2014 leadership, pressure handling, communication, and ethics.\nAll these rounds, back to back, were mentally draining. I had panic attacks. At one point, I was literally crying and breathless during the interview, but somehow \u2014 I held it together.\nI cleared 3 out of 4 rounds. The one I missed? The one where anxiety truly got the best of me.\nStill, HR told me that passing 2 was enough, and I\u2019d done really well \u2014 so they pushed me forward. I went through team matching and everything was going well... until it wasn\u2019t.\nHiring Committee backed out , probably concerned about the one failed round, scheduled 2 more DSA interviews to be safe \ud83d\ude43.\nThen began a 2-month delay full of reschedules and uncertainty.\nOnsite Round 4\nAn array-based problem involving greedy strategy, prefix sums, and hashmap balancing.\nIt felt like solving a complex necklace arrangement problem \u2014 but the question was poorly worded, and the test cases were brutal. I was on the edge the whole time.\nOnsite Round 5\nThankfully, this was a Leetcode contest problem I\u2019d solved 2 months ago and was daily problem a week ago \ud83d\ude09.

I started watching DSA videos in 11th grade and kicked off my LeetCode journey around 3 years ago. That shiny streak? Still going strong \ud83d\udcaa\nA lot happened in October last year. One of my favorite musicians passed away, my mental health took a major hit, and in the middle of all that, I got the email. Google HR reached out saying they wanted to interview me. No referral. Just me, constantly applying and praying my resume made it to the top of the pile. (Tip: BOLD the important stuff in your resume \u2014 HRs don\u2019t have time, and first impressions matter!)\nBut I wasn\u2019t in the best place. Emotionally drained, full of anxiety, I couldn\u2019t even process it properly. And guess what? I got kicked out right after HR screening \u2014 turns out, my current tech stack didn\u2019t align with their needs. Then... the HR ghosted me.\nI was devastated. Thought I got put on a cool-down period. Helpless, I started reaching out to everyone I could. Sent tons of connection requests, begged for referrals. Only one person responded \u2014 based purely on my LeetCode profile. That meant the world. I\u2019ve spent over 3 years grinding here, and it finally counted.\nStill job-hunting, still doubting myself, I got another email from a different Google HR. Same message. A new chance. Meanwhile, I\u2019d already failed over 10 interviews \u2014 Juspay, NammaYatri, Amazon, Goldman Sachs, and more. I realized I lacked in development skills \u2014 I had given everything to DSA.\nBut this time, I was ready. My failures taught me how to speak. How to express. This was my second shot at a better life.\nMy current job wasn\u2019t helping either. Office politics were the worst. My manager kept exploiting my work, taking credit, and during my yearly feedback, had the nerve to say I\u2019m useless without him.\nBut guess what?\nIn the next post, I\u2019ll break down all my interview rounds and in the last one \u2014 my salary negotiation and final result.\nSpoilers: I\u2019M IN.

Hopefully this helps anyone on the fence about how to tackle that dreaded 90-minute timer.\nThe Setup\nDuration: 90 minutes\nEnvironment: HackerRank-style editor, no external libraries\nProblems:\nMedium: Merge k Sorted Lists\nHard: Word Ladder II\nMedium: Count of Smaller Numbers After Self\nI paced myself about 30 minutes per problem, leaving a few minutes at the end of each for quick review.\n1\ufe0f Problem 1: Merge k Sorted Lists (Medium)\nPrompt (summarized):\nYou have k linked lists, each sorted ascending. Merge them into one sorted list and return its head.\nMy Approach:\nUse a min-heap keyed by node value.\nPush the head of each non-empty list into the heap.\nRepeatedly pop the smallest node, append it to the result, and if that node has a next, push next into the heap.\nimport heapq\n\ndef mergeKLists(lists):\n    heap = []\n    for idx, node in enumerate(lists):\n        if node:\n            heapq.heappush(heap, (node.val, idx, node))\n    dummy = ListNode(0)\n    tail = dummy\n\n    while heap:\n        val, idx, node = heapq.heappop(heap)\n        tail.next = node\n        tail = tail.next\n        if node.next:\n            heapq.heappush(heap, (node.next.val, idx, node.next))\n\n    return dummy.next\nEdge Cases & Lessons:\nIdentical values: I included idx in the heap tuple to avoid tie issues.\nEmpty input list: Checked if node before pushing.\nCould\u2019ve been 3\u20134 minutes faster by pre-allocating the dummy and skipping the tuple index, but safe is better under pressure.\n2\ufe0f Problem 2: Word Ladder II (Hard)\nPrompt (summarized):\nGiven beginWord, endWord, and a wordList, return all shortest transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord. Each step must change one letter and land in wordList.\nMy Approach:\nBFS to build a graph of shortest-level connections.\nDFS/backtracking from beginWord to endWord, following only edges that move to the next level.\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef findLadders(begin, end, wordList):\n    wordSet = set(wordList)\n    if end not in wordSet:\n        return []\n\n    # Build adjacency by BFS levels\n    levels = {begin: 0}\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    queue = deque([begin])\n\n    while queue:\n        word = queue.popleft()\n        for i in range(len(word)):\n            for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n                nxt = word[:i] + c + word[i+1:]\n                if nxt in wordSet:\n                    if nxt not in levels:\n                        levels[nxt] = levels[word] + 1\n                        queue.append(nxt)\n                    if levels[nxt] == levels[word] + 1:\n                        graph[word].append(nxt)\n\n    # Backtrack all shortest paths\n    res = []\n    def dfs(path):\n        if path[-1] == end:\n            res.append(path[:])\n            return\n        for nxt in graph[path[-1]]:\n            dfs(path + [nxt])\n\n    dfs([begin])\n    return res\nWhat I\u2019d improve:\nI got TLE on large inputs because I regenerated all 26-letter possibilities each time. Pre-computing generic patterns (h*t, ho*, etc.) would be faster.\n3\ufe0f Problem 3: Count of Smaller Numbers After Self (Medium)\nPrompt (summarized):\nFor each element in nums, count how many elements to its right are smaller. Return the list of counts.\nMy Approach:\nUsed a Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) on the compressed ranks of the values.\nTraverse from right to left, query the BIT for how many have rank < current rank, then update the BIT at current rank.\ndef countSmaller(nums):\n    # Coordinate compression\n    sorted_unique = sorted(set(nums))\n    rank = {v: i+1 for i, v in enumerate(sorted_unique)}\n    size = len(sorted_unique)\n    BIT = [0] * (size + 1)\n\n    def update(i):\n        while i <= size:\n            BIT[i] += 1\n            i += i & -i\n\n    def query(i):\n        s = 0\n        while i > 0:\n            s += BIT[i]\n            i -= i & -i\n        return s\n\n    res = []\n    for x in reversed(nums):\n        r = rank[x]\n        res.append(query(r - 1))\n        update(r)\n    return res[::-1]\nKey Points:\nCompression handles negatives/large values.\nFenwick guarantees O(n log n).\nWhat I\u2019d Do Differently\nTime allocation: I spent 35 min on Word Ladder II and got TLE. Next time, I\u2019d allocate only 25 min to it and move on.\nEdge-case checklist: I missed testing [] and single-element inputs on the first problem\u2014would write simple asserts before coding.\nQuick skimming: I\u2019d note \u201cconstraints: wordList up to 5 k words\u201d and opt for pattern-based adjacency pre-compute immediately.", "vote_count": 6, "comment_count": 1, "view_count": 864, "creation_date": "2025-05-04 12:17:15"}

But I am not in a position to relocate. I still have one year if I change my mind.\nRejections: Stripe and Google\nGoogle, I felt I was a bit unlucky. Got an interviewer who was least interested in the interview and didnt seem like one who wanted the candidate to succeed. He ended up giving a Strong No hire.\nAs for Stripe, no complaints here, I seriously messed up one of my rounds and knew I will be rejected.\nViews on the market: The market is tough right now \u2014 even one weak round can lead to rejection or down-leveling. That being said, good prep still goes a long way. Roles are fewer, but companies continue to hire top talent.\nTips and strategies:\nOne notable shift I observed was the reduced emphasis on traditional LeetCode-style problems. For example, companies like Samsara and Stripe didn\u2019t include any such rounds. The focus has moved towards medium-level coding problems with more weight on how you approach the problem, your code structure, modularity, edge case handling, and overall discussion. Only Meta and Google still stick to hardcore LC-style questions.\nFor System Design, senior roles now expect staff-level depth.

{"id": "6706733", "title": "The No-Nonsense Guide to Mastering LeetCode for Your Dream Tech Job", "content": "Hey folks,\nI\u2019ve been knee-deep in LeetCode for months, prepping for interviews and trying to level up my coding game. Along the way, I\u2019ve talked to friends who\u2019ve scored jobs at places like Amazon, Apple, and smaller startups, and I\u2019ve had my fair share of \u201cugh, why didn\u2019t I see that?\u201d moments. If you\u2019re feeling swamped by LeetCode or wondering how to prep without turning into a coding zombie, I\u2019ve got you covered. Here\u2019s a straightforward guide to making LeetCode your ally, not your enemy, written like we\u2019re just chatting over a burger.\nWhy LeetCode Matters (But Isn\u2019t Your Entire Life)\nLeetCode is a big piece of the puzzle for software engineering interviews, especially at product-based companies like Google or Meta. It\u2019s not just about banging out code\u2014it\u2019s about showing you can untangle a problem, think clearly, and write something that works without a million bugs, even when you\u2019re nervous. But here\u2019s the deal: LeetCode is only part of the picture. Companies also want to see your projects, hear how you work with others, and know you\u2019re not just a code machine. So, let\u2019s talk about how to prep efficiently and still have time for, you know, life.\nMy Key Takeaways for LeetCode Success\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned from my own grind, plus some wisdom from friends who\u2019ve been through the interview gauntlet:\nGo for Depth, Not Just Numbers\nWhen I started, I thought I had to solve 400 problems to be \u201cready.\u201d Turns out, that\u2019s a recipe for burnout. After about 120 problems, I was mostly redoing the same ideas in different flavors.\nAim for 60\u201380 well-chosen problems that cover the essentials: arrays, strings, linked lists, binary trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and two-pointer techniques.\nStick to medium problems\u2014they\u2019re the bread and butter of most interviews. Add a handful of hards if you\u2019re aiming for FAANG or similar.\nCheck out LeetCode\u2019s \u201cTop 100 Liked Questions\u201d or filter by company (like \u201cMicrosoft\u201d or \u201cAdobe\u201d) to focus on what\u2019s relevant.\nGet the Logic, Don\u2019t Just Copy-Paste\nEarly on, I\u2019d get stuck and rush to the solution tab, thinking I\u2019d magically \u201cget it.\u201d Big nope. You need to wrestle with the problem to actually learn.\nGive yourself 15\u201320 minutes to think before peeking at hints. Ask: What\u2019s the input? What\u2019s the output? Can I solve it the slow way first?\nJot down your thoughts\u2014on paper, a whiteboard, or even a random napkin. It\u2019s crazy how much clearer things get when you map it out.\nAfter solving, hit up the discussion tab. You\u2019ll find clever tricks or edge cases you didn\u2019t consider.\nPrep for the Interviewer\u2019s Follow-Ups\nInterviewers love to spice things up with questions like, \u201cCan you optimize this?\u201d or \u201cWhat if the input is a million rows?\u201d You\u2019ve got to be ready to adapt.\nPractice explaining your solution\u2019s time and space complexity in simple terms, like you\u2019re telling a friend.\nKnow how to shift from a clunky brute-force approach to something leaner, like using a hash set instead of a double loop.\nLearn patterns like sliding windows, DFS/BFS, or binary search\u2014they\u2019re like shortcuts that unlock tons of problems.\nPractice Like It\u2019s the Real Deal\nLeetCode\u2019s timer is a great way to mimic interview pressure. Set a 30\u201345-minute limit per problem to get used to thinking on your feet.\nTry mock interviews on platforms like Pramp or Interviewing.io. It\u2019s awkward at first, but it\u2019s gold for building confidence.\nTalk through your solution out loud, even if it\u2019s just to your cat. It\u2019ll make explaining your thought process in interviews feel natural.\nKeep Track of Your Progress\nI started a simple Google Sheet to log my problems: topic, difficulty, link to my solution, and \u201cwhat I screwed up.\u201d It\u2019s like a personal coach for spotting weak spots.\nRevisit problems you struggled with every couple of weeks. You\u2019ll be amazed at how much easier they feel.\nTake a second to pat yourself on the back when you nail a tough one\u2014it keeps the motivation up.\nBonus Tips to Shine Bright\nBuild one solid project with clean code and a nice README. It can impress recruiters more than a high LeetCode streak.\nReach out for referrals. A quick LinkedIn message to someone at the company can get your resume to the top of the pile.\nDon\u2019t sleep on behavioral interviews. Prep stories for questions like \u201cTell me about a time you failed\u201d to show you\u2019re human and learn from mistakes.\nIf LeetCode\u2019s sucking your soul, take a break and study system design or CS fundamentals. Variety keeps you sane.\nYour Starter Plan\nIf you\u2019re wondering where to begin, here\u2019s a quick roadmap:\nWeek 1: Knock out 10\u201315 easy problems to get comfortable. Focus on arrays and strings.\nWeeks 2\u20133: Tackle 25\u201330 mediums across graphs, trees, and dynamic programming. Learn one new pattern, like two-pointers.\nWeek 4: Try 5\u201310 hards and revisit your toughest problems. Do a mock interview with a friend.\nKeep it going: Solve 2\u20133 problems a day, explain one solution out loud, and polish your portfolio.\nMy Thoughts\nLeetCode isn\u2019t about being a coding wizard\u2014it\u2019s about showing you can solve problems, write solid code, and keep your cool. You don\u2019t need to be perfect; you just need to be prepared. Every problem you crack is a step closer to that \u201cYou\u2019re hired!\u201d email. Stay consistent, don\u2019t beat yourself up over mistakes, and you\u2019ll get there.", "vote_count": 15, "comment_count": 0, "view_count": 885, "creation_date": "2025-05-02 05:51:51"}

Would certifications, side projects, or formal education (e.g., online courses) be necessary?\nLanguage Focus: If I stay in development, should I prioritize learning Rust or double down on Java ecosystems (e.g., Spring, cloud tools)? Or is Python a must-learn regardless of the path?\nI\u2019d love insights from experienced professionals:\nIs AI/ML a viable career for someone starting from scratch, or is it oversaturated?\nAre there hybrid roles (e.g., ML engineering, AI-integrated backend systems) that bridge development and AI?\nWhat\u2019s the best way to assess which path aligns with long-term opportunities?\nAny advice, resources, or personal experiences would be hugely appreciated!

It might seem unrealistic to some, but from my perspective, here\u2019s why I believe it\u2019s justified:\nI\u2019ve been solving LeetCode problems daily for the past year, without missing a single day.\nI completed an expensive system design course (you can guess which one xD) to strengthen my architecture skills.\nDue to my contributions at work, I was promoted to Senior SDE within a year.\nI believe my lower current CTC is primarily because I started my career with lower pay, not because of a lack of skill or value.\nThe recruiter asked, \"Considering your skill set, how are you sure about expecting 40 LPA?\"\nIn my mind, I thought \u2014 this is just the first HR call; shouldn\u2019t technical assessments come next?\nI asked for clarification: \u201cAre you referring to my resume or something else?\u201d\nHe replied, \u201cI\u2019m talking about your resume and your communication skills.\u201d\nAt that point, I didn\u2019t really have a comeback about communication skills \u2014 I had nothing to say.\nHe also mentioned, \"Just because the role title matches your current designation doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a fit for the role.\"\nThe role required experience with Django, which I haven\u2019t worked with directly. However, I do have experience with Spring Boot and Node.js, and I don\u2019t believe Django would be a big leap. I said I could pick it up in a month.\nHe responded, \u201cWe have people with 10 years of experience working on Django. And you think you can learn it in one month?\u201d\nAfter that, for every response, he kept saying, \"I am not convinced with your answer.\"\nI still think I can get a better opportunity than this, but I felt he got aggressive during the call, which wasn\u2019t necessary.", "vote_count": 8, "comment_count": 7, "view_count": 1794, "creation_date": "2025-04-19 05:01:59"}

If both arrive at the same time, we return 0. Otherwise, we return 1 for Person 1 or 2 for Person 2, depending on who arrives first.\nApproach:\nThe problem is quite simple and involves calculating the absolute distance from each person to Person 3 and comparing those distances.\nCalculate the Distance: We can calculate the distance from Person 1 to Person 3 as abs(x - z), and similarly, calculate the distance for Person 2 with abs(y - z).\nComparison:\nIf the distance for Person 1 is smaller than that of Person 2, return 1 (meaning Person 1 reaches first).\nIf the distance for Person 2 is smaller than that of Person 1, return 2.\nIf both distances are the same, return 0 (indicating they reach at the same time).\nThis approach ensures an O(1) time complexity, as we only need to perform a few constant-time operations.\nCode Implementation:\nclass Solution {\npublic:\nint findClosest(int x, int y, int z) {\nint dist1 = abs(x - z); // Distance from Person 1 to Person 3\nint dist2 = abs(y - z); // Distance from Person 2 to Person 3\n    if (dist1 < dist2) return 1;      // Person 1 reaches first\n    else if (dist2 < dist1) return 2; // Person 2 reaches first\n    else return 0;                   // Both reach at the same time\n}\n};\nTime Complexity:\nThe time complexity of the solution is O(1) because we are performing constant-time operations (absolute difference and comparisons).\nSpace Complexity:\nThe space complexity is O(1) as we are only using a fixed amount of extra space to store distances.\nQuote: \"The simplest solutions are often the most effective ones.\"\nLink: LeetCode Problem 3516 - Find Closest Person\nEdge Cases:\nBoth at the Same Distance:\nExample: x = 1, y = 5, z = 3\nIn this case, both Person 1 and Person 2 are at the same distance from Person 3, so the result should be 0.\nOne Person Already at the Position:\nExample: x = 2, y = 5, z = 5\nHere, Person 2 is already at position z, and Person 1 has to move.

Let\u2019s turn this thread into a chill space where we can share tips, rant about problems, and maybe even laugh at our coding fails.\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019d love to chat about:\nDebugging Drama: Ever spent hours on a bug only to realize it was a missing semicolon? \ud83d\ude2d Share your most facepalm-worthy debugging stories!\nAlgorithm Anxiety:\nHow do you even start with problems like \u201cReverse the Quantum Flux in a Linked List Matrix\u201d? Do you scribble diagrams? Cry first? Tell me your secrets!\nOptimization Struggles:\nThat moment when your code works\u2026 but takes 10 years to run. How do you speed things up? Any cool shortcuts?\nBrain Freeze:\nWhat do you do when you\u2019re super stuck? Watch cat videos? Take a walk? Beg your rubber duck for help?\nCollab Wins:\nEver solved a problem by teaming up with someone? Let\u2019s hear those \u201cwe did it!\u201d stories!\nMy Confession: Last week, I spent 3 days on a problem, only to realize I\u2019d misread the question. Three. Days. \ud83d\ude43 (Pro tip: Read the question 5 times. Then 5 more.)\nLet\u2019s Help Each Other Out!\nDrop your:\nTips & Tricks (like how to use print statements without losing your mind)\nGo-To Resources (YouTube channels, blogs, or that one friend who gets recursion)\nCurrent Challenges (maybe someone here has cracked it!)\nFunny/Motivational Stories (because we all need a laugh after 10 wrong submissions)\nRemember, no question is \u201cdumb\u201d here! We\u2019re all learning. And hey, if you\u2019re shy, just lurk\u2014but I promise, jumping in is worth it.\nLet\u2019s turn this into the friendliest coding corner on LeetCode! \ud83d\ude80\nP.S. If you\u2019ve got a problem you\u2019re stuck on, drop it below. Maybe we can brainstorm together!\nHappy coding\nAditya kr. mishra", "vote_count": 2, "comment_count": 2, "view_count": 186, "creation_date": "2025-04-08 18:21:27"}

So there will some time invested for this thing too.\nI also faced a situation for the Rain water trapping question the Bar-raiser asked it in last 25mins. He didn't even paste the problem statement, he just pasted an array and gave some vague statement via mouth without even the expected answer. Now you should also be in a state to handle these kind of treatment imagining and solving it in mind with all brute to optimal solutions. Forget about using pen-paper because I didn't even get time to touch them in any of my rounds.\nTimeline for my rounds and offer:\nFor all my rounds recruiter reached out to me the next day of interview round and with 2-3 days gaps for next round. Then finally after 2-3 days of my Bar-raiser round received the offer \u2705.\nLP questions guide:\nFollow this thread for LP questions.

She decided to prepare a goodbye present for her n students and give each of them a jigsaw puzzle (which, as Wikipedia states, is a tiling puzzle that requires the assembly of numerous small, often oddly shaped, interlocking, and tessellating pieces).\nThe shop assistant told the teacher that there are m puzzles in the shop, but they might differ in difficulty and size. Specifically, the first jigsaw puzzle consists of f1 pieces, the second one consists of f2 pieces, and so on.\nMs. Manana doesn't want to upset the children, so she decided that the difference between the numbers of pieces in her presents must be as small as possible.

{"id": "6579616", "title": "Apple ICT3 | Full-Stack Engineer | Interview to Offer | Cupertino ", "content": "How I got shortlisted\nApple hires very specifically for teams and filters by candidates who have highly relevant experience. An initial resume screen is performed by the recruiters and then final shorlist is done by Managers who look for good overlap in technical skills of the candidate and skills required for the role.\nSo it's really important to tailor the resume to the Job description for Apple.\nApplied to about 10+ roles on the Apple Careers site, whose description overlapped with my experience.\nRecruiter Call\nAbout a month later, a recruiter reached out regarding one of the roles. This was for a Full Stack Engineer on an internal ML platform.\nShared my experience and was able to move ahead for a Hiring Manager Round.\nHiring Manager\nA very candid discussion on why I chose the role, my relevant experience, why I would like to join, where I see myself, and why I chose Apple.\nThe conversation was very positive, and I knew I was moving to the next round\nTechnical rounds have a general similarity.\nThe problems were highly vague. They required me to ask the right questions to complete the problem definition and then start working on it.\nThey were very keen on clear communication and discussions.\nTechnical Phone Screen\nProblem 1: A vote counter\nStarted with this vague problem statement and narrowed it down to this -\nBuild a class to read millions of votes from a ballot list and perform rank-based vote counting. Had to handle batching to solve for memory usage.\nProblem 2: Given a Binary tree of 0's and 1's where the left node is the same as the parent and the right node is opposite to the parent, determine the value of the n'th node at l'th level.\nI sketched out a sample tree and then proceeded to use recursion to arrive at the solution.\nOnsite - 5 rounds\nCoding 1\nProblem: Given a set of characters, determine all English words that can be created.\nStarted the discussion on determining the inputs and outputs, the structure of the dictionary to validate against.\nBuilt a trie with the dictionary list and tested every permutation of the characters.\nOptimised it in a second approach by generating a HashSet for every anagram in the dictionary and checking against characters.\nSystem Design\nThis was not a generic design round at all.\nThe interviewer was a very experienced person who had worked with Apple for over 10 years.\nThe round focused primarily on my experience. He picked each of my experiences and we discussed very deeply about my entire task. Why I picked it, what I did (sketched multiple diagrams for each question), how I measured performance, what I would do differently today.\nBehavioral\nThis round was with a senior manager.\nQuestion: Given the values of Apple, such as Deep expertise and Drive for Excellence, how have you showcased these in your career?\nI started picking examples from my first job to my last job, highlighting the different lessons I had learnt - technical, cultural, and leadership.\nSome key lessons I highlighted were -\nKeeping it simple (KISS).\nDon't jump to solutioning too soon.\nRespect everyone's expertise.\nResolving conflicts.\nMotivating team members.\nCoding 2\n**Problem 1: **Given a dataset, sample n items while maintaining the original probability distribution.\nVery straightforward problem, the solution was to maintain the original counts and use random to sample.\n**Problem 2: **Create a React component that can display 1M records.\nThe problem required slicing the data and displaying only records that would fit within the scroll section.\nThis is a classic React interview problem.\nPractice Resource : https://www.greatfrontend.com/interviews/dashboard\nHad practiced questions from here which made this really easy to solve.\nCoding 3\nDiscussed my expertise in React.

{"id": "6575660", "title": "Difference Between Two Ways to Calculate Mid in Binary Search", "content": "When implementing Binary Search, we need to calculate the middle index (mid) to determine which half of the array to search next. There are two commonly used ways to compute mid:\n\u2705 Using (left + right) / 2\nint mid = (left + right) / 2;\nThis is the straightforward and intuitive way to calculate the middle index. However, in some programming languages where integers have a limited range (like C++ and Java), adding left and right directly might cause integer overflow if they are large values.\n\u2705 Using left + (right - left) / 2\nint mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\nThis avoids the potential overflow issue because we first subtract left from right, ensuring that we work with a smaller number before adding it back to left.\n\ud83d\udd39 Example in Binary Search\nHere\u2019s an example of a correct binary search implementation using the safe mid calculation:\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint binarySearch(int arr[], int n, int target) {\n    int left = 0, right = n - 1;\n\n    while (left <= right) {\n        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\n        if (arr[mid] == target)\n            return mid;\n        else if (arr[mid] < target)\n            left = mid + 1;\n        else\n            right = mid - 1;\n    }\n\n    return -1; \n}\n\nint main() {\n    int arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11};\n    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);\n    int target = 7;\n\n    int index = binarySearch(arr, n, target);\n    if (index != -1)\n        cout << \"Element found at index: \" << index << endl;\n    else\n        cout << \"Element not found\" << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\ud83d\udd25 Conclusion\nmid = (left + right) / 2; is simple but might cause overflow.\nmid = left + (right - left) / 2; is the recommended approach to prevent overflow issues.\nAlways prefer the safe version when working with languages where integer overflow is a concern! \ud83d\ude80", "vote_count": 2, "comment_count": 0, "view_count": 255, "creation_date": "2025-03-24 21:59:08"}

He asked me 2 DSA questions.\nFirst question - Build a data structure which can insert, search, delete and get random element in O(1) time. There was a follow up asking what if there are duplicates in the input.\nSecond question - Find square root of a number.

He asked 2 DSA questions.\nFirst question - You are given the starting and ending times for ML models. Each model used a GPU to run. 4 GPUs make up 1 CPU. Find the minimum number of CPUs needed to run all the models. Basically this problem was a variation of the minimum number of platforms question. I followed with the line sweep algorithm first then he asked what if the time intervals are given in decimals then I told him the sorting+two pointers method.\nSecond Question - You are given a matrix full of 'S' and 'O'. Any 'O' or cluster of 'O' that are not covered by S from all directions become 'S' as well. We have to return the final state of the matrix. Basically any 'O' and the 'O' connected to it become\n'S' as they are not covered, so you run a DFS for all 'o' on the edges and convert them one by one to 'S'.

I just told him to ask a question, bro started smirking.\nQuestion - We are given inputs in the form of Username - Page visited.

Finally landed on one class for a Package(dependencies = List[Package]).\nAnother class PackageManager that determines the order of install for a set of Packages.\nBasic DFS solution with optimisation resulted in O(n) solution.\nCoding 2:\nDesign a cache for a search system that can have filters.\nOutcome: Problem was super vague and took me forever to clarify and get to the details.\nWas able to only code a very rough solution with lots of comments. The code was not fully functional, but I was able to explain every part of it and the assumptions and working of every function in the class.

If aiming for job interviews, C++, Java, or Python are widely used.\nStart with Easy Problems \u2013 Begin with simple problems under \"Easy\" difficulty.\nFollow a Roadmap \u2013 Stick to a structured problem list like NeetCode 150 or Blind 75.\nUnderstand Before Coding \u2013 Read the problem carefully, note inputs/outputs, and visualize the approach before coding.\nBreak It Down \u2013 Divide the problem into smaller steps and solve each step logically.\nUse Debugging Tools \u2013 Print intermediate values to understand your logic.\nQ2: How to align your goals as a programmer with lead code ?\nCompetitive Coding\u2013 If interested in coding contests, solve problems regularly and increase difficulty gradually.\nJob Preparation \u2013 Focus on Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), starting with arrays, strings, recursion, linked lists, trees, graphs, and DP.\nSystem Design Aspirations \u2013 If you want to excel in backend interviews, focus on graph theory, databases, and optimization problems.\nSoftware Development Practice \u2013 Solve real-world related problems and try to build projects based on learned concepts.\nQ3: How to start solving problems or learn how to solve them for example should you use YouTube libraries or just look at the solution step in each problem and try to match your code with it ?\nWhich language to solve code with is the best for you ?\nTry solving first \u2013 Even if you're stuck, think about the problem logically before checking solutions.\nLearn from Solutions \u2013 After attempting, compare your approach with optimal solutions.\nUse Tutorials Wisely \u2013 Follow structured tutorials like NeetCode, CS Dojo, or freeCodeCamp.\nAvoid Memorization \u2013 Understand the logic instead of memorizing code patterns.\nWhich Language to Use?\nPick Based on Your Needs:\nPython \u2013 Best for beginners, interviews, AI / ML and data science.\nJava \u2013 Great for object-oriented programming and backend development.\nC++ \u2013 Fast execution, commonly used in competitive programming.\nJavaScript \u2013 Useful for frontend and full-stack development.\nSwift/Kotlin \u2013 If you're into mobile app development.\nGetting Most Benefit\nQ4: How can a person get the most benefit out of solving a problem over lead code ?\nWrite Down the Approach \u2013 Understanding why a solution works is more important than just writing code.\nTime Complexity Analysis \u2013 Check if your solution is optimal (O(n), O(log n), etc.).\nReview & Reattempt \u2013 Solve the same problem after a few days without looking at past solutions.\nDiscuss & Learn \u2013 Participate in forums or discuss with peers.\nQ5: What is the most effective way to learn while solving problems ?\nApply the \"Active Recall\" Technique \u2013 Try explaining your solution to someone else.\nTrack Progress \u2013 Use platforms like LeetCode Streaks, GitHub Repos, or a Spreadsheet to track solved problems.\nFollow a Category-based Approach \u2013 Solve problems topic by topic instead of random problems.\nOptimising Time & Progress\nQ6: What is the best approach to dynamically keep solving problems while learning ?\nMix Easy, Medium, Hard \u2013 Start with easy problems, but introduce medium ones as you get better.\nUse the \"20-Minute Rule\" \u2013 If stuck, spend a max of 20 minutes thinking before checking hints.\nSet Weekly Goals \u2013 Example: Solve 5 problems per week focusing on one category.\nQ7: How to optimise your time to solve problems while being engaged with your regular life activities ?\nUse Small Time Blocks \u2013 Solve one problem a day (~30 mins).\nPrioritize Problem Solving Over Tutorials \u2013 Watching too many videos can slow progress.\nPractice in Intervals \u2013 Solve problems when commuting, before bed, or during breaks.\nApproaching Techincal Code\nQ8: How should i as a new commer approach new concepts like:\nComplex statements: Break them down into smaller conditions. Write comments to simplify logic\nAlgorithm Optimization: Learn time complexity (Big-O notation)\nAdvanced Data Structures: Learn arrays \u2192 linked lists \u2192 stacks/queues \u2192 trees \u2192 graphs step by step.\nDynamic Programming Paradigms: Understand memoization vs. tabulation, solve Fibonacci, Knapsack, LCS problems first.\nRecursion and Iteration tradeoffs: If recursion is slow (stack overflow risk), use loops or memoization.\nHandling Edge Cases & Debugging: Always test with empty inputs, large numbers, duplicates, negative values.\nLanguage Specific Constraints: Understand memory handling (e.g., Python is slower than C++ in some cases).\nImplementing Tree or Graph Algorithms: Start with BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm before moving to *A search and MST (Minimum Spanning Tree)\nPlease keep your answers as simple and as consice as possible. The Aim is to help new commers and fix complicated views and make learning simple.\nThanks to all contributers !\nHelp others the same way you wanted to be helped", "vote_count": 3, "comment_count": 0, "view_count": 251, "creation_date": "2025-03-18 12:37:47"}
